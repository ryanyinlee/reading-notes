### Semantics

Defines what the meaning or effect a piece of code has. This is different from what it looks like vs what effect it has.

The example given by Mozilla describes how you can *make* something look like a top leve heading through HTML code, but it will not function the same as it is recognized differently and doesn't get the same benefits.

Using proper semantics can help with the following:

- Search engines
- Screen readers for the visually impaired
- Semantic code is easier to search through
- If lacking data, can help you figure out what is supposed to go there.
- Semantic naming conventions usually match up to what will be entered.
