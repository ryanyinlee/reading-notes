## React Docs - Thinking in React

**What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?**

The idea that component should only do one thing, similar to deciding if some code needs to be a function.

**What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?**

A version of the application that has data and UI, but doesn't have any interactivity. Done by building components that can pass props. State should not be used.

**Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?**

Interactivity with state.

**What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?**

(from reactjs.org)
```
Is it passed in from a parent via props? 
Does it remain unchanged over time? 
Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
```

If any of these can be answered yes, they are likely not state.

**How can you identify where state needs to live?**

- ID what component will render something based off of state.
- Find the component that needs it the most.
- In the tree/hierarchy, the top most component should own it.


## Higher-Order Functions

**What is a “higher-order function”?**

A function that works on functions the same way that a regular function takes in values.

**Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?**

```
function greaterThan(n) {
  return m => m > n;
}
let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greaterThan10(11));
// → true
```

It looks like it's evaluating whether m is greater than n.

**Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.**

Map works by transforming an array and creating a new one by putting all of the array values through another function.

Reduce works by continuously adding all of the values in an array until it's condensed into a single datum.

## Things I want to know more about

I think I need to read a bit more on states and props as well as practice more with the fat arrows.
