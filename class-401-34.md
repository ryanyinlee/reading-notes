# Class 38 Reading Notes: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

**How granular should your reducers be?**

Reducers can be as granular as needed, as sometimes there are different parts of your app that need to respond differently to each action. If your reducers have different use cases then they may need to change more individual attributes.

However this isn't always the case.

**Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched**

This is a pro if intentional, but a con if not intentional.

**Name a strategy for preventing the above**

Keeping action names separate and having separate smaller functions responsible for smaller bits of state.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- store: Where the state tree of the application is held. Change the state by dispatching an action on it.
- combined reducers: Sticking your reducers together in the index.

## Class 38 Live Notes / Live Journal

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Test driven development for a shopping cart.

**What did I learn today?**

Review of building the cart function as I couldn't quite figure it out. 

Reducers and redux is starting to make a little more sense to me but it's still fairly difficult.

**What should I do differently next time?**

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

**Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:**

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**
