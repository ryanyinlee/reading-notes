**How to Solve Programming Problems**

"Measure twice and cut once." - Planning is more important than diving right in. Writing code right away is a mistake.

Gives instructions on how to solve a programming problem using 6 steps. Quoted directly:

"**A simple set of steps**

*70% of time should be spent in steps 1-3*

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code."


Understanding before coding will help a lot.

Quoted directly:

"...understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation."

"It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question."

Steps outline:

1. Read the problem completely twice.

- You must fully understand the problem to the point you can explain it to someone else.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- Programming is automation. Anything that can be done with automation can also be done manually. 
- Writing the problem through manually will give you the steps you need to automate.
- Solve through mathematical induction.
- Look for corner and edge cases as well.

3. Optimize the manual steps.

- Before coding, the solution should be optimized as it's much easier to do on the whiteboard or in your head first.

- Can it be solved easier?

The article gives an example with reversing the string "zebra".

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- Capture all the steps and put them into the editor as comments or pseudo code.
- Gives a sense of structure.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

- Take each comment and replace it with a line of code.

Should be able to do the following: 

- Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list, or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc


6. Optimize the real code.

- Not always necessary, but good to do.
- See where things can be cut or made simpler.
- Variable names should be long and descriptive. Someone should be able to understand your code.

For large problems: Divide and conquer! Take it in halves if necessary.

**How to think like a programmer**

Problem solving is one of the more important skills for a programmer to have.

1. Understand: Know the problem in and out.
2. Plan: Write down the steps you need to solve the problem.

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

3. Divide: Break the larger problem into sub-problems. Connect the sub-problems to solve the larger problem.
4. Stuck?: Debug!
5. PRACTICE: Take time to solve problems, or micro-problems and think about them using this process.


**Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive**

Most of our time is effectively wasted on low quality or pointless activities.

Treating your time as actually valuable, as it should be, would result in a change in attitude that can increase one's productivity, efficiency, and focus.

The time spent on work shouldn't be just to be busy, but with a focus on actions that truly matter for oneself rather than just for the appearance of being busy.

Visions and goals should be crystal clear.

*"Cultivate with extreme focus with whatever you do."*

Treating your time as valuable will also lead others to doing the same.

**5 Whys: Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly**

Define the problem: A brief concise definition of the issue.

First Why: Why is this problem occuring?

Ask "Why?" 4 more times. Each successive why should be a question as an answer to the previous Why.
