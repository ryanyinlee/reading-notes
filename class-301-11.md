## nosql vs sql: 
https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

1. 
SQL: Relational Databases

NoSQL: Non-relational/distributed databases

2. 
SQL: Table based (data in table form)

NoSQL: Document based, key value pairs, graph, or wide coloumn.
Non standard definitions. 

3.
SQL: Predfined schema.

NoSQL: Dynamic scheme for unstructured data.

4.
SQL: Verticably scalable. Scalable by increasing power of hardware. CPU, RAM, SSD on a single server.

NoSQL: Horizontally scalable. Scalable by increasing the number of servers to reduce load and handle more traffic.

5.
SQL: Good fit for complex queries.

NoSQL: Not good fit for complex queries.

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Transactional applications, as they are more stable.

**Give a real world example.**

I'm guessing by "transactional" they mean either sales or banking type transactions.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Large data sets like JSON documents.

**Give a real world example.**

New York Times as an example, key-value pairs seem like they'd be more useful for storing things like long news articles and images.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL databases as they use key-value pairs for storing large data sets.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

Seems like NoSQL databases just need more servers to handle increased load.

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?**

A relational database is a database that stores tables related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Tabular structure.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

"A logical collection of datbase objects" - Rajenda Gupta

It's a method to separate objects within a database for different applications.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

Not Only SQL or Non SQL databases are databases that are not table based and use key-value pairs. They are non-relational.

**How does it work?**

Magic. 

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Documents, JSON Objects, fields and values. Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB is more flexible because it scales easier while being able to have more diverse types of data.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

You may not be sure that all the data you need meets your particular requirements. They are not as easy to update large facets of data compared to updating table data.

They don't support atomicity, consistency, isolation, or durability (ACID) transactions.

## Things I want to know more about

## Lecture Notes / Caches / Caching

Caching - data in memory.

Makes data access faster (accesing from a cache is 0.25ms).

Data costs money to get.

Checking if item is in cache.

When a client asks for data

Check in cache for that key. 

*If we HAVE the key*, then grab the data associated with the key and send to user.

*If we DO NOT have the key*, then make the API request, get the data back, store it in the cache for next itme.

Store the data in a key value.

How to time stamp data? (if it reaches a certain age, it must be replaced)

```
const { id_number } = req.query;

if (cache(id_number)) {
    res.status(200).send((cache[id_number]))
    return;
}
```



## Data Access Scale

1. Data in memory (0.25ms) 1x
2. Data on SSD (1ms) 4x
3. Memory over network (nearby) (10ms) 10x
4. Data on HDD (20ms) 20x
5. Round Trip From Foreign Source Online (150ms)
