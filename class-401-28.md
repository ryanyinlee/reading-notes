# Class 31 Reading Notes: Context API

**Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()**

useReducer gives you more control over the state management.

useReducer is useful when the next has a dependency on the last one to be more predictable.

Also useful when the state is more complex than a primitive value.

**Why do custom hooks need the `use` prefix?**

They don't necessarily require it, but by using `use` you are conforming to ReactDocs and can see right away when a function has the Rule of Hooks applied to it.

**What do custom hooks usually do?**

Custom hooks can do: form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and other useful functions.

**Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications**

Form validation!

**Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work**

Use componentDidMount()

use `fetch` and the API

get the `response` and datify it so your state can understand it.

use the new state from teh api

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- reducer: A function that takes two parameters, the current state and an action object which the reducer updates and returns a new state.

# Class 31 Live Notes / Learning Journal

State gets "rained down" on components.

Context API 

In React, state is immutable. Changing state requires returning a new state (which lets you save old state in history)

action === {} -> actions are always objects with 1 minimum required field type: 

let action = {
    type: reduction,
    something: something
}

Very helpful to console.log the props for each component.

Class components and Functional components have the same lifecycle methods available.

Initial Render:

Check if logged in

## Producer

Producer of context(state)

Context Component. 


```js

export default function Footer (props){
    console.log('FOOTER PROPS ', props);

    return (
    <footer>
    <Card interacti>
    </footer>
    )

}

```

themeContext.js

```js
import React from 'react';

class Theme extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            mode: "dark"
        };
    }


    render() {
        return (

            <ThemeContext.Provider value = {this.state}>
            {this.props.children}
            </ThemeContext.Provider>
        )
    }

}

export default ThemeContext;

```
