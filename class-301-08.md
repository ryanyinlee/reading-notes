Java is strictly written

JavaScript is lightly written

TypeScript? Imposing rules where there weren't before.

Asynch/Await review

## Custome Express Server in node.js

## porque

- secure our keys
- scale our application, caching
- single source to fetch all data it needs
- lets a server do the hard work of formatting data to feed front end

## what
- node.js and express
- web/http server
- listens on a port 3001 (react app will be on port 3000)
- receives requests (GET), "does work", 

## Steps Required to Make a New Server

clone repo from github
ls
npm init
- answer the questions
- give it an entry point (server.js)
- git repository
- license

can also give npm init -y for defaults 

ls and package.json should exist with server info.

npm install dotenv cors express

The server.js file:
```
'use strict'

// import blah from blah
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express()
console.log(app);
app.use(cors());

const PORT = 3001; // or using the .env: = process.env.PORT


// set up routes

app.get('/test', handleGetTest)

function handleGetChristmasList(request, response) {
    res.status(200).send(list);
}

function handleGetTest(request, response) {
    response.send('your test worked!');
}

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log('server is listening on port ', PORT);)




```

run server

node server.js

in the .env

PORT=3001


How to render from the app:
// import axios
```
import axios from 'axios'
```

// Make a request using axios to the server

christmasListRequest = asynch() => {
    const gottenChristmasList = await axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_URL}/christmaslist`);
    this.setState({ christmasList: gottenChristmasList.data })
}

componentDidMount() {
    this.christmaslist
}

// get back the list
```
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        christmasList: []
    }
}
```
// set it in state

```
christmasList: []
```

// render the list from state

```
{this.state.christmasList.length > 0 && this.state.christmasList.map(item => <li>{item}</li>)}
```
