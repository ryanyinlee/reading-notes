# Class 19 Readings: AWS: Events

**Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server**

An AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions seem to have the same REST/CRUD functions but separated as the Lambda functions are individually responsible for the CRUD, using the API gateway to hit the paths.

**List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each**

Amazon Aurora: MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Amazon DynamoDB: KeyValue NoSQL DB. Scales quickly.

Amazon ElastiCache: Cache that exists on the cloud.

Amazon Keyspaces: Apache Cassandra database service. Don't have to manage servers or install software. Serverless.

Amazon MemoryDB for Redis: In-memory DB compatible with Redis. Open source.

Amazon Neptune: Graph database for storing billions of relationships with low latency.

Amazon Relational Database Service: Relational DB in the cloud. Resizable with scalable hardware provisioning.

Amazon RDS on VMware: Similar services as the ARDS above, but lets you deploy on VMware environments.

Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB): Centralized cryptographic ledger useful for banking/credit transactions. Also works with blockhains.

Amazon Timestream: A time series DB for data that changes over time.

Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility): A document storage DB


**Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

Standard queues make it so each message is delivered at least once.

FIFO are strictly exactly once processing. The message is delivered once and remains until the user processes it.

**How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

Through the use of a Dead-letter queue, any messages that aren't properly received can be put back into the cycle.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Serverless API: Where a large server is not used, and applications run only briefly when invoked.

Triggers: A software action that invokes the serverless function to operate when necessary (e.g. when a file is uploaded).

Dynamo vs Mongo: Dynamo is only on AWS. MongoDB can be used anywhere. MongoDB can store more stuff, Dynamo has limited key-value.

Dynamoose vs Mongoose: Modeling tools for their respective databases. Dynamoose for Dynamo and Mongoose for MongoDB
