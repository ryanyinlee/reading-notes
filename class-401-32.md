**What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**

Cookies are harder to attack and are automatically sent in every HTTP request to the server.

**Explain 3rd party cookies.**

Third party cookies are set by a website that isn't the same as the on you're currently on. Used to track users between websites.

**How do pixel tags work?**

Pixel tags are code snippets that are used to gather information about the user.
