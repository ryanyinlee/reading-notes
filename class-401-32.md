# Class 36 Application State with Redux

**What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**

Cookies are harder to attack and are automatically sent in every HTTP request to the server.

**Explain 3rd party cookies.**

Third party cookies are set by a website that isn't the same as the on you're currently on. Used to track users between websites.

**How do pixel tags work?**

Pixel tags are code snippets that are used to gather information about the user.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- cookies: A block of data created by the server when a user visits it. Can store stateful information.
- authorization: Request header to provide credentials for authentication of a user with a server.
- access control: A method of security for restricting users by privilege.
- conditional rendering: Rendering only the things you need, based off of specific conditions.

Warmup Prompt: Write a function that can perform a breadth first traversal of a Graph.

- Testing Auth and Login

- State management with reducers

    - What is a reducer function? 
        - A way to consolidate management of state
        - The reducer function alters state.
        - We want to return a new state (a new object, NOT a mutation of the existing object)

```js

function reducer(state, payload) {
    switch (payload.type){
        case "ADD_NAME":
            return {...state,name:payload.value}
        default: 
            return: state;
    }
}

```

- Provider and Consumer components
    - Provider: The context component that provides the `context` / `data` / `behaviors` to its children
    - Consumer: The thing that consumes the content => uses the `data` / `behaviors` to do something.
        - Has to opt in.

- Testing Providers and Consumers

```js
// AuthContext.test.js
import AuthProvider from './context/auth'

describe('Testing Auth Provider Behavior', () => {
    it('should provide isAuthorized to Consumers', () => {

        const testConsumer = (props) =>{
            returns (
                <>
                    <p data-testid="isAuthorized"> {props.isAuthorized}</p>
                </>
            )
        }

        render (
            <AuthProvider>
            <testConsumer>
            </AuthProvider>
        )
        expect(screen.getByTestId('isAuthorized')).toEqual(false);
    });
});

```

## Global Application State

Last week focus was on specific features that ideally only a subset of components use
- Authenticated only auth components need to consume these values/behaviors
- Settings and theme: only styled components or menus and dashboards

Redux is designed to be a system that potentially all parts of our UI need.
