## React and Forms

**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

When the React component both renders the form and the resulting form with the values controlled by React.

**Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**

It looks like based off of the examples that use handleChange, it will update immediately - but we likely don't want that for most cases, so it's better to wait until submitted.

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

By submitting what the set.state.value is via a submit button that connects to a function. This should hopefully be after the info is completed.


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Ternary Syntax

```
condition ? value if true : value if false
```

Condition is being tested.

Gives true or false.

Separate conditional from **true** with ternary operator (?).

The colon (:) separates true code from false code.

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

It's an If statement but in a much shorter space.

**Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  ```

Re-written:

```
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```

  ## Things I want to know more about

  If this.handleChange immediately sets the state, does that mean you can type in info and have it appear elsewhere immediately, like it was mirroring the user's typing?
