##### Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is the rough sketch and design of your UI for your website or app. It lets a designer figure out how to organize their site visually, and figure out what works and what's missing.

Wireframing isn't for aesthetic design (colors and themes are not part of the process), but more for finding out practical use.

##### Wireframe Examples

Wireframes can be done via hand or software.

Hand-drawn wireframes are *very* easy to change and draw.

Changes and testing are easy to do with face to face feedback.

##### Things to consider before you start wireframing

The task required can change how complex the wireframing needs to be. A simple process or task can go with a regular whiteboard drawing, but if it is a heavily involved task, with lots of resources at stake then a more complex and refined wireframe is useful.
