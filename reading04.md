### Structure web pages with HTML

##### Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is the rough sketch and design of your UI for your website or app. It lets a designer figure out how to organize their site visually, and figure out what works and what's missing.

Wireframing isn't for aesthetic design (colors and themes are not part of the process), but more for finding out practical use.

##### Wireframe Examples

Wireframes can be done via hand or software.

Hand-drawn wireframes are *very* easy to change and draw.

Changes and testing are easy to do with face to face feedback.

##### Things to consider before you start wireframing

The task required can change how complex the wireframing needs to be. A simple process or task can go with a regular whiteboard drawing, but if it is a heavily involved task, with lots of resources at stake then a more complex and refined wireframe is useful.

##### Wireframing Tools

Pen and paper - relatively cheap, fast, and easy.

UXPin - Can make actual clickable prototypes.

InVision - Also clickable mockups.

Wireframe.cc - A quick and easy browser based version of pen and paper suitable for wireframing.

### 6 Steps to make a wireframe

1. Research
- Audience
- Requirements
- Creating user personas - A fictional person who might use your software or site.
- Use cases
- Competitor research
- Current trends
- Best Practices
- Any internal use guidelines
- Check other parallel applications for inspiration

2. Have all research ready for reference

- Cheetsheet - Basically all of the above in an easy to read format
    - Business goals
    - User goals
    - Personas
    - Use cases
    - Quick reminders on neat features found

3. Map out user flow
- Lets you figure out how many screens you need.
- Where users are coming from and what they might expect.
- Users should be able to figure out things without assistance from external sources.

4. Actual drafting
- Begin wireframing with the above research and concepts in mind
- Drafting means just the basic features.
- No colors, UI, or aesthetics are necessary.
- Create the "skeleton" only for now.
    Pose 4 questions:
        - Is content organized for end user goals?
        - What information should be immediately accessible?
        - What would the user expect to see on each page?
        - What interaction does the user need to do to reach their desired goals or information?

5. Add some detail and test
- Begin adding information details to the wireframe
- Go top to bottom, left to right
Think about these details while filling out details:
    - Usability
    - Instructional text
    - Tooltips to indicate specific functions

Begin testing: First among colleagues and desingers, then actual potential users.

6. Turn the wireframe into a prototype.
Can use software tools such as:
    - Proto.io
    - Adobe XD
    - Framer
    - Sketch
    - Figma

### How to make a good wireframe (3 Principles)

1. Clarity: Immediately answers what a site is, and what the user can do.
2. Confidence: Being predictable, intuitive, and organized will help user confidence. Familiarity can help.
3. Simplicity: Overwhelming the user can be counterproductive.
