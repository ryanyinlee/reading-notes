## How I explained REST to my brother

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Original coder and researcher to write the first web servers. Developed HTTP. Developed REST.

Authority on computer networks.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because how different the technologies are from machine to machine.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

The protocol uses GET to grab resources from the website in a way that lets them communicate efficiently. It applies the "verbs" to the "nouns" provided.

**What does a GET do?**

Sounds like it "gets" data.

**What does a POST do?**

Sends data to the server.

**What does PUT do?**

Similar to POST. Puts new information into the server.

**What does PATCH do?**

Applie an update, not a complete change, but a modification.

## Lecture Notes:

WRRC 

HTTP - how two things talk to each other
a system of rules for two or more entities to communicate

syntax, semantics, synchronization, and error methods

http is a network protocol built on top of TCP which was built on IP

Request

Get

## REST

- a resource oriented architecture: interface uniformity

client/server architecture, without any state or session preservation, a resource represntation cahing, use of hte http protocol and its methods.

- REST is the standardized way of structuring web APIs for requests. REST is a style based on several principles.

APIs adhering to REST are called RESTful APIs.

REST APIs use a request/response model where every message from the server is the response to a message from the client.

RESTful APIs use HTTP as its transport protocool. 

## APIs

- Application Programming Interface: Acts as a middle layer between two applications to allow them to communicate.
    - Needs good documents to be clear about how they work.
