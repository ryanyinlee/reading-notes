# Class 37 Reading Notes: Redux - Combined Reducers

**Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?**

You would use Redux for more dynamic type data. Redux is easier to extend to add new data/actions. 

Debugging is easier with Redux Dev Tools.

UI logic and state logic are separated.

**What is the purpose of a reducer?**

A reducer is a function that takes the state and action as arguments and returns a new state.

**What does an action contain?**

Actions are JS objects with a `type` field that describes what happens in the JS application.

**Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?**

The reducer is not allowed to modify the existing state - the updates made are immutable so they copy the existing state and make changes to the copy.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- immutable state: Data that can't be changed
- time travel in redux: Use of Redux Dev Tools to inspect state and travel back in time to see what it was prior.
- action creator: How things happen in Redux. 
- reducer: A function that takes the state and action as arguments and returns a new state
- dispatch: A method that is used to update the state that lets the store run reducer.
