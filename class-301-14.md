## What is OAuth
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html

**What is OAuth?**

OAuth is open-standard authorization that lets sites and services that have no relation use the same authenticated credentials for access without actually sharing the privileged information.


**Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

Logging into a third party website (like Heroku or Netlify) but they allow you to use your GitHub credentials to create an account and gain access.

**How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

Multiple services are trying to get approvals for a single transaction via authorization (rather than authentication).


OAuth is described as being like a car's valet key - you can drive and park a car, but can't get complete access.

This was easier to copy-paste from Wikipedia than try to describe on my own:

```
1.	(Not pictured) The user requests a resource or site login from the application.
2.	The site sees that the user is not authenticated. It formulates a request for the identity provider, encodes it, and sends it to the user as part of a redirect URL.
3.	The user's browser makes a request to the redirect URL for the identity provider, including the application's request
4.	If necessary, the identity provider authenticates the user (perhaps by asking them for their username and password)
5.	Once the identity provider is satisfied that the user is sufficiently authenticated, it processes the application's request, formulates a response, and sends that back to the user along with a redirect URL back to the application.
6.	The user's browser requests the redirect URL that goes back to the application, including the identity provider's response
7.	The application decodes the identity provider's response, and carries on accordingly.
8.	(OAuth only) The response includes an access token which the application can use to gain direct access to the identity provider's services on the user's behalf.

```

**What is OpenID?**

OpenID is for authorization for people logging into machines and was incorporated ito OAuth.


## Authorization and Authentication flows
https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/flows

**What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

Authentication: User proving its ownership of an identity:

Authorization: Letting a subject access resources after authentication.

**What is Authorization Code Flow?**

- exchanges an Authorization Code for a token.

**What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

Additiona security on top of ACF.

**What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

Alternative to ACF, OAuth 2.0 is for public clients or apps that can't store things secretly.

**What is Client Credentials Flow?**

Machine to machine applications for authentication and authorization.

**What is Device Authorization Flow?**

Alternative method for user authentication by having them use a different device. Similar to how an Xbox may ask you to sign on your phone to authorize a movie payment.

**What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**

For highly trusted apps, require username and PW with a form, only used when ACF can't be used.
