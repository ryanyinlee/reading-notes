# Class 40 Live Notes DSA Review

*You are tasked with creating a Vending Machine that can lookup items sold and compute whether or not a customer has provided enough coins to purchase a selected item.*

*The vending machine has 2 important features.  Storing information about the products sold by the `Vending Machine`, this includes information about the current `inventory` and the `price` .  And computing the total amount of money provided by a customer given in coin based increments (1 / 5 / 10 / 25 / 50).  How would you implement these `Vending Machine` features?*

JB's Process on the Whiteboard:

Function that takes in an item and the amount of cents available. Returns one item if all good (available and money right) otherwise return null.

INPUT: String, collection of coins.
OUTPUT: String, or null.

## Data Structures

Table of Items

Item: {count, price}

e.g. 
Snickers, 5, 100
Hot Tamales, 3, 90

Coin Collection [pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollar]

Feels like a hashtable

Item Coins: Is desired item in stock? 
            If No, return null.
            Determine price of item
            sum the coins as cents
            if cents >= amount then reduce item count
            return item
        else return null

## Test Cases

Assume item is in inventory
Assume coin colleciton is fixed
Length of 5, zeroes used.

Case 1:

in -> Snickers, [0,0,0,4,0]

Snickers as a key

IN stock? Yes
price of item = 100
cents = sumCoins(coins)
#cents = 100

reduceItemCount();
return Snickers (with itemCount of snicekrs reduced by 1)

Case 2:

Sad Snickers (Out of Stock)

in -> Snickers, [0,0,0,4,0]

inStock? No
Return null

Case 3:

Sad Snickers (Not Enough Money)
in -> Snickers, [0,0,0,3,0]

inStock? Yes
price of item = 100
cents = sumCoins(coins)
#cents = 75
cents < priceOfItem
return null


```js
inventory = {
    "snickers":[5,100],
    "hot tamles": [3,75],
}

function puchaseItem(itemName, coins){
    itemData = inventory[itemName];
    itemCount = itemData[0];
    
    if (itemCount < 1) {
        return null;
    }

    priceOfItem = itemData[1];
    sumOfCoins = sumCoins(coins);
    if (sumOfCoins >= priceOfItem) {
        reduceItemCount(itemData);
    }


}

function sumOfCoins(coins){
    const denominations = [1,5,10,25,50];

    let tally = 0;

  for(num in coins){
     //console.log(`${num}: ${coins[num]}`);
     tally += coins[num] * denominations[num];
     //console.log(tally)  
  }

  return tally;
 
} // end of sumOfCoins

function reduceItemCount(itemData){
    itemData -=1;

}

```
