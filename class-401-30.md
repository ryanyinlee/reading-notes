# Class 33 Reading Notes: <Login /> and <Auth />

**Why is the Context API useful?**

It lets you bring state to a child component without having to "thread" it through multiple components that don't actually use or need it.

**Can a component outside of a provider get its context?**

Through the use of `useContext(MyContext)` it will use the context value of the nearest `<MyContext.Provide>` above the calling component.

When `<MyContext.Provider>` rerenders with an update, the `useMyContext` will update as well.

**What are some common use cases for using the Context API?**

Changing from light theme to dark theme. A filter for a list of items (e.g. only certain brand of shoes)

**Describe “Context Hell”**

Severe over use of React.Context leading to a large series of nested Providers, which makes for nasty to read code.
