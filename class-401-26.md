# Class 30 Reading Notes: Hash Tables / Hash Map

A data structure used to store information. Built into nearly every programming out there as a default, similar to an array.

Use Key, Value pairs. Keys are not ordered like arrays.

They are fast: finding, adding, removing values.

Key can be a name, Value a phone number creating an associative array which maps the two together.

Hash(key) -> index

As long as the key is the same it will spit out the same index number.

JavaScript uses Objects and Maps, (although Objects can only use strings);

## Hash Definitions

- Hash: How you determine an index of the array.
- Buckets: The item contained in the index.
- Collisions: When multiple keys are hashed to the same location.


## Structure

Hashing: A has code makes a key into an integer. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

The algorithm should not be random, but can use a variety of different methods to determine the index from the key.

## Collisions

When more than one key hashes to the same index there is a collision. Collision handling is important to a hash map.

The best way to solve a collision in a bucket is to create a LinkedList in the bucket. Collisions can now be added as Nodes in the LL.

## Hash Storage Steps

- Get key
- Use algo to create hash for key
- Convert hash into array index
- Store the key with the value by adding to a linked list in bucket

## Hash Retrieval Steps

- Receive key
- Figure out what the hash should be based on algo
- Find the array index of the hash
- Get the bucket at index
- Look through the Linked List bucket for the node with the matching key/value pair


## Internal Methods

**Add()** 

Add a new key value pair.

**Find()**

Accept a key, get the hash of key, and go to index.
 
Find (if it exists) the key value pair.

**Contains()**

Get a key, return boolean if it exists in the hashtable.

**GetHash()**

Accept a key as a string, return index of where they key/value should be.
