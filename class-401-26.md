# Class 30 Reading Notes: Hash Tables / Hash Map

A data structure used to store information. Built into nearly every programming out there as a default, similar to an array.

Use Key, Value pairs. Keys are not ordered like arrays.

They are fast: finding, adding, removing values.

Key can be a name, Value a phone number creating an associative array which maps the two together.

Hash(key) -> index

As long as the key is the same it will spit out the same index number.

JavaScript uses Objects and Maps, (although Objects can only use strings);

## Hash Definitions

- Hash: How you determine an index of the array.
- Buckets: The item contained in the index.
- Collisions: When multiple keys are hashed to the same location.


## Structure

Hashing: A has code makes a key into an integer. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

The algorithm should not be random, but can use a variety of different methods to determine the index from the key.

## Collisions

When more than one key hashes to the same index there is a collision. Collision handling is important to a hash map.

The best way to solve a collision in a bucket is to create a LinkedList in the bucket. Collisions can now be added as Nodes in the LL.

## Hash Storage Steps

- Get key
- Use algo to create hash for key
- Convert hash into array index
- Store the key with the value by adding to a linked list in bucket

## Hash Retrieval Steps

- Receive key
- Figure out what the hash should be based on algo
- Find the array index of the hash
- Get the bucket at index
- Look through the Linked List bucket for the node with the matching key/value pair


## Internal Methods

**Add()** 

Add a new key value pair.

**Find()**

Accept a key, get the hash of key, and go to index.
 
Find (if it exists) the key value pair.

**Contains()**

Get a key, return boolean if it exists in the hashtable.

**GetHash()**

Accept a key as a string, return index of where they key/value should be.

# Class 30 Live Notes / Learning Journal

Learned hashtables!

Made several methods.

**Add()** 

Add a new key value pair.

**Find()**

Accept a key, get the hash of key, and go to index.
 
Find (if it exists) the key value pair.

**Contains()**

Get a key, return boolean if it exists in the hashtable.

**GetHash()**

Accept a key as a string, return index of where they key/value should be.

# PPH: Rover

**Who was the speaker(s) and what company or companies were they from? What was the topic of the talk?**

Speakers were Alex, Rosie, Josh, Jacob, Richard, and Elizabeth from Rover talking about software engineering interviews.

**Share 1 or 2 ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.**

Interview structure: Two to three rounds 

- Phone Screen
- Behavioral interview
- Tech assessment
- Pair programming
- Take home project
- Final round interviews (used to be in person)

Ask Questions:
- Ask about the company!

## Behavioral

Practice!

Talk about yourself or accomplishments.

Know that you're a team player.

How you solve problems.

What you find interesting and career goals.

Research the company's values as this is what the interviewers are looking for. Rover's values is disciplined debate

e.g. How did you problem solve together?

## Technical Interview

Make sure you know front and back your project so you can explain it properly.

Review data structures!

Use the language you're most comfortable with - they want to see you problem solve, not that your syntax is perfect.

Practice problems: Leetcode, Hackerrank

Be honest, as you will not always know the answer - Don't BS your answer. Talk it through and be collaborative.

Discuss edge cases, test the solution, what happens when an error gets thrown?

## Project Manager Interview

Behavioural

Analytical Exercise

Case questions: Rover and non-Rover

Looking for right level of altitude for end consumer

Data driven reasoning to get to "so what"

Concisely summarize the complex technical and business topics across teams. 

- You don't have to do 100%

Customer advocacy

Ability to assess/balance risk

You are going to bomb some interviews, don't think that's you as a person. Try not to freak out about it.

What would you want in a Jr Engineer?

When asking questions: Tried googling, looking in the codebase, make sure due diligence is done.

Read articles, tried to see how else it was used

**Do you have any other key take-aways, or observations about this Partner Power Hour?**

## Top Thing A Candidate Should Do/Not Do

- Jacob

Do:

Really get familiar with the company and the product.

Do Not: 

Use a lot of profanity

- Richard

Do: 

Ask questions!

Do Not:

Talk poorly about employers or past experience. Figure out a way to rebrand that.

- Josh

Do: Ask Questions during interviews. Write down the answers.

Do Not: Stay silent! Talk about what you are doing in the technical interview. Ask questions. Give them an idea that you are actively thinking about and working on the problem.

- Alex

Do Not: Just talk without saying anything. Stay focused and don't ramble off topic. 

- Elizabeth

Do: Listen to your interviewer, they are trying to help you out. If you go down the wrong path, they want you to succeed.

## Career Coaching Workshop 4: Peer-to-Peer Mock Interview Workshop (Behavioral Interview)


Write about your number one takeaway from interviewing a peer today. How does being on “the other side of the table” change your perspective on how you need to approach interviews?

Also write about at least two points of feedback your interviewer gave you during the workshop. What practical steps will you take to sharpen your interviewing skills?

## Behavioral Interview Feedback


Say something: Did a good job of instilling my work habits and communication skills which made them better, and made the company better. 
Think of a time when you disagreed with a rule: Upper management wanted us to do something that would negatively impact the business or the team dynamic. The customers wouldn’t benefit from a change. 

Rephrase: When you’re focusing on a job you may come off as impersonal.

Javascript promise

Work on tell me about yourself - modified in-depth elevator pitch.

Solved a tough problem - figure out.

Slow down, ask a clarifying question, think about the answer you’re going to give.

Don’t necessarily admit that you make a mistake, keep rolling and no one really knows unless you bring attention to it.
