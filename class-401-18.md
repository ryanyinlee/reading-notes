# Class 17 Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

**Describe “The Cloud”**

The Cloud is a collection of IT resources over the internet that range from storage to processing ability that can scale on-demand to the user's needs.

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a way to package your application (code, config files, and dependencies) into one object. 

**What is auto-scaling?**

Auto-scaling is the AWS monitoring of your applications to change the resources used, either up or down (with a concurrent change in cost) based on their use and capacity.

**What is bandwidth?**

The amount of data transmitted over an internet connection over an amount of time, usually calcualted in megabits per second (Mbps).

**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

Through the use of auto-scaling for usage of bandwidth as well as capacity for storage of application and user data.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances: A virtual instance of a server that has a CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
- Containers: A container is a way to package your application (code, config files, and dependencies) into one object. 
- Cloud Services: The Cloud is a collection of IT resources over the internet that range from storage to processing ability that can scale on-demand to the user's needs.
- Cloud Architecture: How individual tech is combined to create cloud services, from distributed servers, data centers, and bandwidth.
- AWS: Amazon Web Services - a provider of cloud computing services.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Heroku is a bit easier to setup than the AWS Beanstalk. Heroku's pricing structure outpaces AWS by quite a bit. Heroku has no SSH access to their servers for additions, whereas AWS does. Heroku is better for small simple projects, whereas AWS is better for a project you plan to scale up significantly.
