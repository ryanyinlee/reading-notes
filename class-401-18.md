# Class 17 Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

**Describe “The Cloud”**

The Cloud is a collection of IT resources over the internet that range from storage to processing ability that can scale on-demand to the user's needs.

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a way to package your application (code, config files, and dependencies) into one object. 

**What is auto-scaling?**

Auto-scaling is the AWS monitoring of your applications to change the resources used, either up or down (with a concurrent change in cost) based on their use and capacity.

**What is bandwidth?**

The amount of data transmitted over an internet connection over an amount of time, usually calcualted in megabits per second (Mbps).

**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

Through the use of auto-scaling for usage of bandwidth as well as capacity for storage of application and user data.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances: A virtual instance of a server that has a CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
- Containers: A container is a way to package your application (code, config files, and dependencies) into one object. 
- Cloud Services: The Cloud is a collection of IT resources over the internet that range from storage to processing ability that can scale on-demand to the user's needs.
- Cloud Architecture: How individual tech is combined to create cloud services, from distributed servers, data centers, and bandwidth.
- AWS: Amazon Web Services - a provider of cloud computing services.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Heroku is a bit easier to setup than the AWS Beanstalk. Heroku's pricing structure outpaces AWS by quite a bit. Heroku has no SSH access to their servers for additions, whereas AWS does. Heroku is better for small simple projects, whereas AWS is better for a project you plan to scale up significantly.

# Class 17 Live Notes/Learning Journal

- Did warmup on a BST: 

Prompt: Given a Binary Search Tree, return an iterable of all the integers from lowest to highest

What methods do we have access to: only adding
Is an array okay? Yes
BST: Already sorted
No limits on data-structures

Strategy: Use In-Order traversal
    - Favor reading left subtree before anything else
    - As we read the values, insert them into the array

```js
function lowestToHighest(root){
    const lowToHigh = [];
    let current = root;
     inOrder(root, (value) => lowToHigh.push(value));
     return lowToHigh;

}


// Using inOrder which we already had.
    inOrder() {
        let data = [];
        var current = this.root;
        function traverse (node) {            
            if (node.left) traverse(node.left);
            data.push(node.value);
            if (node.right) traverse(node.right);
        }
        traverse(current);
        return data;
    };

```

Virtual Machines: An instance of the OS on a physical machine.
    - Contained within another OS
    - The higher level OS provisions some resources.


What is Elastic BeanStalk?: Wrapper around the 
    -Handles the config of an EC2 instance.
    - Specifically for web services.
    - An Elastic Beanstalk environ is the config for the system that the application is running on.


## Serverless Infrastucture

What is a serverless infrastructure? Micro-server is a much better term
    - We are removing monolithic (singular?) servers.
        - Very large code bases.
        - They are *hard* to manage.
- Get rid of huge servers and use the smallest server/service possible.
    - Functionality will be expressed minimally.
    - Run a function, triggered in various ways, but always does 1 very specific job.

## Lambda

    Learning how to do a Lambda function.

    Every Lambda function must export a property called handler

    ```js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    // TODO implement
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify(event),
    };
    return response;
};
    ```

# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Scalable storage in the cloud.

- A repository for anything, Amazon calls it a bucket.
    - Built for programmatic access (reading and writing) by humans and machines.
    - Very cost effective - you only pay for reads
- Why not use a DB?
    DBs are only good for scalar (immutables)
        - stings, numbers, booleans

Bucket works for videos, images, text files or other large format values.
