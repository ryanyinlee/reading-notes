## Class 06 Reading

**Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)**

A regular class that is instantiated only once and re-used.

**Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes**

Through the use of a environmental variable accessor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2NxMWQn85c

Example from past notes:

```js
const POSTGRES_URI = process.env.POSTRES_URI || "sqlite:memory";

let db = new Sequelize(POSTGRES_URI);
```

**If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?**

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html

First I'd want to figure out what the middleware is necessary for.

Create a middleware directory, create a .js file named appropriately that has the function I need, then call it in with `app.use(middleware)`

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

_Router Middleware_: Same as application middleware, but bound to `express.Router()` http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.router

_Dynamic Module Loading_: From Wikipedia: When a program grabs a library, loads it into memory. uses the functions/variables within the library, executes those variables/functions and then yeets the library from the memory. https://dev.to/hasnaindev/dynamic-module-pattern-for-javascript-dynamically-load-javascript-bundles-m5c

_Singleton Pattern_: A design pattern where a class is only instantiated a single time. Helps with coordination. 

_CRUD -> REST Method Matches_:

Create - Post

Read - Get

Update - Patch/Put

Delete - Delete/Destroy

_Mock Testing_: Create a fake version of an service. https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-test-software-part-i-mocking-stubbing-and-contract-testing/

## Class 06 Live Notes

### Important Concepts From First Week

- HTTP

  - Web serve protocol.
    - Request: Get Post Put Patch Delete
    - Response: Providing the client with information.

- Express

  - A framework that operates within Node.js for an HTTP server.
  - Routing: How express handles everything needed to put together a response.
  - Method/route path and a callback function ot run when those match.

  - Middleware: Functions that execute during the lifecycle of the request to the Express server.

    - In express we use the next function to call the `next` middleware inline.
    - Can middleware happen in one direction?
      - In express yes.
    - Error handling - uses a middleware fucntion.

  - Error handling - uses a middleware function. Error handles calls the error by passing error as an argument into the `next` function.
    - The middleware being used as an error handler, needs `error` param.
  - SQL and Sequelize
  - What is SQL

    - A database that stores information in tables/rows.
    - Is relational, data records (rows) are related to data in ohter tables.
    - SQL does't allow you to delete data that is related between tables.

    - What is a Sequelize Model?
    - A blueprint for an item in the database.
    - Defines a whole table (Model = table).
    - Each Data type = column.
    - Create an instance of the model with values = Row in SQL.

- Modularization
  - Refactoring: Re-writing something that doesn't change the behavior. Clenaing things up, not repeating.
  - Abstraction: Cleaning up/hiding details that aren't needed.
  - Taking behavior that is important, providing a generic way to do the same thign in multiple places.
- Hiding complexity
- Blueprint filter, what they may need to eo in other places in our app.
- See better wheere you have repetition.
  - Used to increase maintainability.

## What is Authentication?

Basic question: Who are you? - Can prove to me who you are. - Website/profile info/banking data/facebook - Ever server needs to know who the user is if they are trying to fulfil specific requests to that user.

How do computers know who is making a request? - UserID: What is this? - What if user 2 says they are user 1 - JWT - JSON Web Tokens

    - User name and a password
    - IP  address
    - Finger prints
    - Retina scans/facial recog
    - MFA
        - Send a text message with a code.
        - Send an email with a verification string


    ## Authentication

    ```js

let decoded =

async function encrypt(password) {
let hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
// level of complexity for our hash

    console.log(hash);

}

encrypt(pass);
```
