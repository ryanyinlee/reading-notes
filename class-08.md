### Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)

**Normal Flow**

Standard flow of elements without modification.

**Relative Positioning**

Adjusted by CSS file. Movement is based off of position where it would have been under Normal Flow.

**Absolute Positioning**

The other elements will no longer "wiggle" around an element with absolute positioning. It is no longer in the flow.

**Fixed Positioning**

When fixed the position of the element will stay in the browser window and never move, even as the user scrolls.

**Overlapping Elements**

Use ``Z-index:`` to change the overlap of elements and bring some items back or forward.

Higher numbers are closer to the user.

**Floating Elements**

``float`` will make an element go all the way in one direction and other elements will flow around it.
