### Choosing a Text Editor

Text editor is basically that - a program used to input text from the user. Some can be as simple as
the basic word processing notepad programs installed by default in most computers or available in browsers via a URL,
but there are several useful features that exist specifically for use with making programs.

#### Features

Features in a text editor are what make them useful to a programmer. A few useful features are summarized by the author as such:

- Code Completion
- Syntax Highlighting
- Themes 
- Extensions


##### Code Completion

Code completion is when the text editor sees what you are writing and is able to figure out possible endings that are required to finish it properly. 

The major benefit is this can make you much faster and more efficient, and potentially reduce mistakes and bugs as it closes tags and brackets automatically.

##### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting colorizes specific text in code such as variables and modifiers as well as other elements. This visually distinct coloration makes it easy to proofread code and find mistakes, as well as just being easier to read and understand.

##### Themes

Themes allow a user to change the overall color scheme (such as the syntax highlighting) the background, and other aesthetic features of their text editor. This allows them to customize it to their liking, but also has the practical advantage of reducing eyestrain when using dark backgrounds.

##### Extensions

Some text editors can add features that are more specific to user requirements or desires via extensions or plug-ins that can add functionality not available in the standard text editor.



#### The Text Editors You Have Already vs. The Ones You *Can* Get

Most operating systems already come with a text editor installed - but they are often suited for a different purpose and functionality than the type that a programmer may use.

For one they have very basic ones that will have almost no features or functionality that would be useful to a programmer.

Others that do come more full featured are designed for people crafting documents rather than software. If WYSIWYG features are shown (What You See Is What You Get), then it's likely the text editor isn't suitable for programming use.

While it's possible to use a basic text editor to program, it can be more difficult to find mistakes due to lack of syntax highlighting, take more time as there is no code completion and without the ability to add features it can make things unnecessarily difficult.
