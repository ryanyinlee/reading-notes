# Class 20 Learning Journal 

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Today was project prep and we have a team that seems to gel well together so far.

We had a really good PPH today. I put in a lot of notes and takeaways that I'll be keeping for future use because of it. Ryan Pederson had a lot of experience to share and good advice.

**What did I learn today?**

We learned about each other's strengths and weaknesses, as well as nailed down our project goals and plans.

**What should I do differently next time?**




**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

I think our UML is not complete as it should be - but I'm not entirely sure what it needs. I think we have a good basic framework for what needs to be done.

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**

## Partner Power Hour

1. Who was the speaker(s) and what company or companies were they from? What was the topic of the talk?

Ryan Pederson from Microsoft. He works clearing roadblocks out of the way of engineers, as well as any "future aspects". Less time actively in code. He has lots of experience, has been coding since 10 and worked with multiple start ups and large companies.


2. Share 1 or 2 ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

I asked "Do you think your startup experience helped you get work in more established companies?"

He said, "yes and no"

Yes - Any experience helps at all.

No - The way you work in a startup is very multi-hat, wearing all the hats, transitioning to one fire after the other is not like what you'd experience at a larger business.

There are fires in a larger business but they are planned and farther apart and less about a company losing money at the end of the month.

He did say bootcamp grads are considered "diamond in the rough" there are are some things you bring to the table that we don't consider valuable:

Life experience that translates 

Familiar with how to be an adult - not as shocked or overwhelmed with the expectations of being a professional.

Stories about CF grads:

Scott Falbo - Has to have trust with his clientele, successfully put ink into their body. Has to set expectations regarding a permanent thing that is etched into your skin.

Skills are very similar to communicating with stakeholders about a software feature. Lifespans are different for both of those, but have similar skills regarding the relationship.

He never stopped writing code. Took 6-7 months after graduation to get hired.

Regarding Microsoft's LEAP Program - Know what the requirements are before it's open. Reach out to people such as Ryan Pederson (find him on LinkedIN) and get it sorted. Said feel free to reach out to him.

You must have a growth mindset.

Difference between a "know it all" and a "learn it all".

Expectations of what they know when they come in.

An understanding that you don't know and you should listen and absorb.

Have you been part of a lot of interviews? If yes, what were some of the aspects that "wowed" you about the interviewee ?

- Thousands of interviews!

The code you're writing should be "interview code". The interviewer has a short amount of time to see if they want to work with this person.

How would you work through this list? Don't try to make the problem what it's not.

There is not an expectation for elegence. Need to see you work with a data structure.

A multi dimensional array can be brute forced for example. 

What's happening then is the interviewer wants to ask you the next question, "okay how do you change it?"

In these 2 lines of code, what would you do a little different, what would you change?

Soft skills: Low drama, self aware. Team should be a group of people with diversity, but imagine a TV show, if these people were cast would be fairly boring.

Diversity of thought and voice. Some people charge forward, some people pump the brakes and iron out things first. Having both of those people gives a good balance.

Look for mentors! Use networking as a superpower, a personal force multiplier.

When Ryan Pederson is looking for jobs on a job board, but calling friends.

3. Do you have any other key take-aways, or observations about this Partner Power Hour

Code that you write needs to be simple, not fancy.

Sometimes your blockers may be trying to make your code fancy.

Read the Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries (Microsoft Windows Development Series)

I think I'll grab a physical copy so I can use it as a reference.

Find open source projects. Find opportunities to write code.

Do you have a love of movies or projects, a game of cards?

Find a way to turn that game into a piece of software. Doesn't have to be pretty or beautiful, it's not going to be.

When those interviews come in, you'll be confident because writing code will be natural.
