# Class 26 Reading Notes

**Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**

Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Node.js, Ember.js

**Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?**

With a library you are the one who decides when and where to call the elements of the library. When you use a framework, it is more organized and curated, with a few options for the user to input their code.


- Rendering: The output of code in the browser.
- Templates: A chunk of HTML that is pushed to the page via the DOM.
- State: The data required for the application is kept track of over time for it to operate.
