# Class 26 Reading Notes

**Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**

Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Node.js, Ember.js

**Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?**

With a library you are the one who decides when and where to call the elements of the library. When you use a framework, it is more organized and curated, with a few options for the user to input their code.


- Rendering: The output of code in the browser.
- Templates: A chunk of HTML that is pushed to the page via the DOM.
- State: The data required for the application is kept track of over time for it to operate.

# Class 26 Live Notes/Learning Journal

M1 chips require additional steps with SASS.

Going to function component

## Warmup

Given an array of numbers, create a valid binary search tree from those numbers.

Write a function

Empty array
Need a valid node and tree class

## Dario & Matt's Solution

```js
class Node {
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree{
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }
}

function traversal(array) {
    let tree = new BinarySearchTree;
     
    // for of loop to iterate over array
    for (let number of array) {
        let newNode = new Node(number);
        let current = tree.root;
        if (!current) { 
            tree.root = newNode;
        } else if (current.value > newNode.value) {
            if (!current.left) {
                current.left = newNode;
            } else {
                current = current.left;
            }
        }
    } else {
        if (!current.right) {
            current.right = newNode;
        } else {
            current = current.right;
        }
    }

    return tree;
}


```



## What is React: Conceptual Review (20 min)

What is React?

- A UI Library
- Open Source
    - Maintained by Facebook, but all source code is published.
- A framework for a front end
- Uses `Components`
    - Small reusable pieces of an interface
    - Atomic (components )


## Class Based vs Function Components
    Lets you defined constructurs for 
```js
    class Main extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            this.state = {}
        }
        
    }


    // Pure something not mutable

    function Main() {
        return (
            <div>
            {...content}
            </div>
        )
    }

```


- We no longer have an instance object that we can refer to by `this`.
- When mutations happened, things like re-render data, and perform functionality on mutaiton
- Get better performance than class performance

## Hooks

- Pure functions that hook into React
Lets React know there is a change and should react to it.
- Fetch someting
- Re-render my data
- useState() => let's us define some values and react when they change

Can't be used in a class component because of the important of `this`


sass!

```js

$background-color: red;
$text-color: yellow;

// mixins let you define reusable blocks

@mixin theme($background: pink) {
    background-color: $background-color;
    color: darkturquoise;
}

#header {
    font-size: 200px;
    background-color: $background-color;
    // sass lets us nest, nesting will override
    p {
        color:$text-color;
        background-color: $background-color;
    }

}

p {
    @include theme
}

```

## Big O Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waPQP2TDOGE

The question: how does algorithm speed scale when input scales becomeing very large?

As input becomes very large, O(n) algorithm becomes much larger than linear time.

O(n) gives 

Upper Bound to function behavior, not going to go past a n^2 squared function.

O(n) mistake - What is n?

Example: 2 strings of input (m & n), your runtime is not O(n).

n: s1.length
m: s2.length

Gives us O(max(m,n))

### O(1) "Constant Time"

As an algo gets very very large input, the runtime stays the same.

The line stays level

Big O is about the way something scales

### O(log(n)) "Logarithmic Time"

- Normally log base 2

So log(16) = 4. Why? 2^4 = 16. That is 4 steps of halving 16 to get to 1.

Halving:

### O(n) "Linear Time"

Most common.

- n tree nodes
- n array elements
- n string length

### O(n*log(n)) "What the fudge"

Fast Sorting:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Levels of work, and then linear work.

### O(n^2) "N-Squared"

- Naive solution to a problem
- Naive sorting algorithms


    - Bubble sort
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort

Two comparisons

e.g. 

`[1,2,3,4]`
and
`3,2,1,0`

### O(2^n) "Exponential Time"

Backtracking problems.

Recursive problems creating forks.

Fibonacci

Subsets

### O(n!) "n-factorial"

Permutations e.g. "cat" forks 3 times, then forks twice

For each of those 2 forks, they'll be forked once.

Appears as 3x2x1, or 3!. Gives n!


## Space Complexity

How does the space usage scale as input gets very large?
