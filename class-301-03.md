## React Docs - lists and keys

**What does .map() return?**

Map returns a new array, but with the array's contents modified by a function.

**If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**

Use of the .map() function and put them in curly braces ``{}``.

**Each list item needs a unique ____.**

Key string.

**What is the purpose of a key?**

Keys are for identification of elements that have been modified.


## How to Use the Spread Operator (â€¦) in JavaScript

**What is the spread operator?**

The spread operator is an ellipses, or three dots. ``...`` for expanding an array into its list of arguments.

**List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

Copying an array
Concatenating or combining arrays
Using Math functions
Using an array as arguments
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React
Combining objects
Converting NodeList to an array

**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**

```
const arrayOne = [1,2,3];
const arrayTwo = [4,5,6];
const comboArray = [...arrayOne,...arrayTwo];
comboArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6];

```

**Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**

```
const arrayOne = [1,2,3];
const arrayTwo = [4, ...arrayOne];
arrayTwo = [4, 1, 2, 3];

```


**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**

```
const arrayOne = [1,2,3];
const arrayTwo = [4,5,6];
const comboArray = [...arrayOne,...arrayTwo];
comboArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6];

```

Is this not the same as above?

**Adding to a state in React**
(directly from medium.com)
```
  // React Hooks declarations
  const [searches, setSearches] = useState([])
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("")

    const handleClick = () => {
    // Add the search term to the list onClick of Search button
    // (Actually searching would require an API call here)

    // Save search term state to React Hooks
    setSearches(searches => [...searches, query])
  }
  ```



## How to Pass Functions Between Components

**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

It looks like he creates a new function where the state he wants to change is at to pass in an object.

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

The name gets received, finds a matching object in the array, and modifies it and stores it in a new array using map(). The modification is done to the count via p.count.

``this.setState`` is then used to update the object above.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

Through the use of {this.nameOfMethod} in the child component.

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

Through the use of this.props.nameOfMethod()
