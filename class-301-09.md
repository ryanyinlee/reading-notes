## Functional Programming Concepts: https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa

**What is functional programming?**

A style of programming through the use of pure functions. There are no shared states or mutable data.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

A function where the inputs are delcared and not hidden, same as the outputs using the parameters.

It will always return the same results if given the same arguments and has no side effects, which means it doesn't modify things outside of itself.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

They aren't reliant on outside values or objects. Easier to test

**What is immutability?**

Unchangeable. Data is not changed, but if you want to change it you create a new object with the same value.

**What is Referential transparency?**

When a function always has the same result for the same input it should be referentially transparent.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

**What is a module?**

A module is similar to JS library, a set of functions you can use in the application.

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

The require() function includes a module.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

Call it in by requiring it and placing it into a variable.

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**

By making it explicitly available 

``module.exports = (function you want available)``
