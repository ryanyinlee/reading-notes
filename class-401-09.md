Basic uses authentication using a username and secret.

Bearer uses a token (like OAuth).

**What does the JSON Web Token package do?** https://www.akana.com/blog/what-is-jwt

A method for securing APIs by sharing security info with encoded JSON objects signed with a crypto algorithm.

**What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?** https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/

It must not be shared. Good idea to be 256 bits generated by a cryptographically secure library, converted to hexadecimal. Never include it in public clients. Never stored in plain text.

- *encryption*: Encoding or hiding information, which can be de-encrypted back through use of a key or algorithm.
- *token*: The thing that applications use to make API requests for the user: https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/
- *bearer*: The possessor of the token.
- *secret*: The secret code that acts as the password for the application.
- *JSON Web Token*: A standard for data with signatures and encryption for their payloads. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token
