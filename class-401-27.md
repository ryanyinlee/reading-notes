## John Cokos Lecture Live Notes / Learning Journal

Context is ~ kinda global state

State sucks because you have to thread it through so many needles.

Context is a way to mitigate that passing being annoying.

(will learn Redux in a week from now to learn about global state)

With context the state is maintained around all the components, but every time it changes every single component has to re-render.

Context should be used for the theme chosen (e.g. "the temperature of the house")

Not going to solve everything.

LL will be a process that will be repeated every time

Queue. FIFO. A checkout line (queue). |  Stack: FIFO. Ice cream scoops on a cone.

Dequeue                             Peek                     pop() give you the next thing you're supposed to see (and then it goes away)



Traversals are destructive! 


Process a queue, it destroys the data structure. Data structures are self destructive. They go away as they are "processed".

Common to have a stack of nodes that you can pop off and drop into a queue.

And then process that queue into a new stack.

What is the big(O) of this?

It is O(1) constant space because no new data is created, only moved.

O(1) for time.

## Trees

Binary, BST, K-Ary Tree

1) Binary: Each node only has 2 children

2) BST: Same as binary, but also ordered, less is left, greater is right ( just looking left or right)

3) K-Ary Tree - Has 'K' children (have to a for each over the tree)

Can traverse them:

Depth first - down all the way one side (recursion, or while loop)

Breadth first - going across each level ()

Sorting arrays question on Final

Linked List on Final

Stacks and Queues on Final

Memorize Sorting (merge-sort), (bubble sort), (quick sort) for Final


## Hash Table

An object, with key and value. Basically an array of Linked Lists

{
    key: value
}

Does table contain John? (true)

What is John? (bald)
