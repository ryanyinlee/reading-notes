**Other Notes**

Node.js is event driven - all actions are reactions with asynchronous behavior (non-blocking). 

The model has very little server overhead which allows multiple simultaneous connections.

Downsides:

Node is single thread only - which can cause CPU issues.

Callback coding can cause potential issues.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

 Greater efficiency - I found that once I was paired with a good team-mate who I felt psychological safety with it was easy to go back and forth with ideas and attempt them. Feedback was immediate and useful regardless of direction, and little bugs that might have tripped us up are much easier to spot in a pair with another person.

**How does pair programming work?**

There is a driver and a navigator. The driver programs (types) and the navigator is the one who guides the driver. Navigator is for big picture, while the Driver does little things like make sure syntax is good, manage where files go and are modified, version control (git acp), and other mechanics.
