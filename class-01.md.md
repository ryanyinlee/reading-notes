# Duckett HTML & CSS

### Introduction (pp.2-11)

HTML and CSS are useful for more than just the people who design and make websites. Anyone tangentially related to working with the web can use it.

HTML: The basics and bones.
CSS: Styling and layout for presentation of the website.

**How People Access the Web**

Browsers: Software used to access websites via links, bookmarks, or actually typing in the address desired. This software is updated constantly, but not by all users all the time, which can limit functionality.

Web Servers: Where the pages of a site are hosted. Most large companies host their own, but smaller sites can be hosted by dedicated hosting server companies.

Devices Used: Not just desktop computers, but tablets, phones, and laptops, all of which have different abilities and requirements.

Screen Readers: Programs for people with visual impairments. These allow pages to be accessible to more people, but can also be used in other ways where it's not easy to read.

**How Websites Are Created**

What You See: Websites are usually interpreted from their HTML, and CSS code. Sometimes with JavaScript as well. They can have other content such as images, audio, or video.

How It Is Created: Smaller websites just use CSS or HTML. More complex websites may have more advanced functionality, but are in fact just creating more HTML and CSS in different arrangements for browsers to interpret.

HTML5 & CSS3: These are newer versions of HTML and CSS, as these are both continuously being upgraded and developed. Learning earlier versions of these languages should assist in learning these newer ones.

**How the Web Works**

1. ISP > Enter in domain name or web address in browser.
2. DNS finds IP address associated with web address.
3. Unique number from DNS Server lets computer directly connect to web server.

### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

**How Pages Use Structure**

Structure of a web pages will often mimic their hardcopy counterparts. Newspapers with articles, or insurance forms that must be filled out.

**Structuring Word Documents**

Documents use headings and subheadings to give the information a hierarchy. Large headings which describe the colection of sub-headings within a longer article, and subheadings to break up longer articles.

**HTML Describes the Structure of Pages**

We use HTML to create similar structure that might appear in WYSIWYG word processor through code, using headings, text, and subheadings as an example.

HTML uses elements, usually made up of two tags, an open and a close that affects the code or text in between them.

**HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages**

``<html> </html>`` - Everything in between these is HTML
``<body> </body>`` - Everthything between these should show up in the main browser window.
``<h1> </h1>`` - Main heading
