**The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e

I think this article is useful for a software engineer to read for the simple fact that it has two different concepts built into it.

1) What he was doing wasn't illegal.
2) But it was still unethical, even if he wasn't responsible for its design.

I can see how as a coder you can be given a set of directions and a schematic and you go to work engineering it as requested - but it may not be until you've finished and can see the completed work to realize the implications.

Some questions that arise are: 
- What can a junior developer do about this? 
- Can they petition management to change the requirements?
- What if the realization the side effects were deadly didn't come until much later, what would the ethical obligation of the coder be later on?

It's difficult to be the one to pipe up and say "what we're doing is wrong". It's almost against human nature as we are so tribal and group oriented as a culture and species, but there are instances like this where you have to be the one to stick out and say something - it may just be Occam's Razor and a mistake can be rectified. If not, then it's the coders responsibility to refuse the unethical work and state exactly why with a paper trail.
