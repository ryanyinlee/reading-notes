# Class 34 Reading Notes: API Integration

**How do bearer tokens work?**

An authentication server creates a token for you after a succesful login and a user client is authenticated. The token is now able to be used by the user client to get access to a resource.

**Describe express middleware**

express middleware are basic functions that can be called to function based on request and response objects.

**What is a JWT?**

JSON Web Token - a method of transmitting secure information as JSON objects.

Can be encrypted, but more likely to be signed which is for verifying integrity rather than secrecy.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- role based access control: Changing access granularly by giving particular access to users.

- http cookies: A piece of data a server places in a client's browser for the use of remembering stateful information.

# Partner Power Hour 6

**Who was the speaker(s) and what company or companies were they from? What was the topic of the talk?**

Sophia Hain and Marcus Ramirez from All Hands, a social advocacy tech recruiting company.

**Share 1 or 2 ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.**

This is the sort of software development I would be interested in as they offer job matching for civic, social, and advocacy campaigning organizations.


The only issue I have is they may not want to hire a junior developer as they have non tech decision makers, which means there might be less structure for me to learn properly depending on the type of organization. This would be worse for me and the organization.


I think once I'm settled I want to pivot towards one of these organizations, even despite a lower pay, but I would want to get experience at a more structured firm beforehand.


**Do you have any other key take-aways, or observations about this Partner Power Hour?**

I took notes on Political Campaigns, PACs, Committees, Consulting Firms, Tech Vendors, Labor Unions, Charities, and Issue Advocacy Orgs to see what I should apply for.


**Political Campaigns**: Fast pace, low pay, high impact, concrete goals, on-site.

Temporary with long hours. Decision makers not experts in tech, have to translate and explain 

**PAC**: Not as fast.

Better paid

High impact.

COncrete goals.

Non-tech decision makers.

Some remote. Some temp, some long term. Scale up and down in between election years.

**Committees**

Fast pace, but slows.

Medium, higher end pay.

Less impact, more infighting. Good for infrastructure.

Goals, Timelines: Concrete

Decision Makers: Have some tech talent to lead teams, but most decision makers are technical.

Usually DC based.

**For Profit: Consulting Firm**

Pace: Cyclical

Pay: Higher side, similar to corporate.

Potential for direct impact: Very high, but can work for campaigns that aren't your favorite or have weak theories of change.

Goals/Timelines: Longer timelines.

Decision Makers: CTOs

Location: DC/NYC

High job stability, more structured.

**For Profit: Political Tech Vendors**

Pace: Electoral cycle sprints.

Pay: Higher

Potential for direct impact: Not as direct

Goals/Timelines: Fast sprints during cycle with hardset deadlines

Decision-Makers: Always technical

Location: Remote

Overall: Smaller teams working with private sector tech people

**Labor Unions**

Pace: Better work life balance.

Pay: Medium-High

Potential for direct impact: Very tangible.

Goals/Timelines: Longer term goals.

Decision-makers: Rarely technical

Location: Usually DC and NYC.

Overall: Very stable job. Not as technically adept. Less external tech use.

**501(c)3s - Charities**

Pace: Very slow

Pay: Lowest pay, working on foundation funding

Potential for direct impact: Long term outcomes, less political, more service.

Goals/Timelines: Impact hard to measure - lack strong theory of change.

Decision-makers: Never technical.

Location: NYC and major cities.

Overall: Many are just "awareness" pet projects.

**501(c)4s - Issue Advocacy Orgs**

Pace: Varies

Pay: Varies on size, low-med

Potential for direct impact: Longer-term strategies, less cyclical. Smaller wins, but more often.

Goals/Timelines: Build in house infrastructure.

Decision-makers: Technical at larger ogs, non-tech at smaller.

Location: Big ones in NYC, DC, SF.

Overall: Large ones have in-house tech/data teams. Often hire consultants.


## Whiteboard Notes / Feedback 

- Practice the space/tool management for Miro

- Package all code in one text block for simplicity

- Be more formal when presenting

- "A general sense of how I want to solve this"

- "Details will be forthcoming"

- Jumped to code too quickly - need to fully understand algorithm first (finish pseudocode)

- Wasn't clear what needed to be turned into code 

- Can at least communicate the problem solving vs the syntax if syntax is unavailable

- For Big O, describe the analysis and why 

- Practice describing "teaching" what it is and how to do it



# Implementation: Graphs

Summary: A non-linear data structure that can be looked as a collection of nodes connected by edges.

**Common Terminology**

- Vertex - Basically a node with zero or more node attached to it.
- Edge - Link between nodes.
- Neighbor - The node adjacent.
- Degree - How many edges are stuck to a node.

## Directed vs Undirected

**Undirected** Does not move in any specified direction. Each edge (link) is bi-directional.

Sort of like a regular traffic intersection.

**Directed** Every edge is directed, each link only connects to another specific node.

Sort of like downtown Seattle with all its one way streets.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

The types of graphs.

- Complete Graphs: All nodes are connected to all other nodes. Sort of like a peer to peer internet?

- Connected: All nodes have at least one connection. This may be like your laptop connecting to a router node, which then connects to the internet.

- Disconnected: Some of the nodes don't have any connections. This is like when your wifi dies and you have to play that dinosaur jumping game in Chrome.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

Cycles are when you can traverse nodes and potentially go back to the same node. 

**Cyclic** 

A graph with cycles Like the board game, Monopoly, which goes in a cycle.

**Acyclic**

Directed graph, no cycles. Like the board game, Life which goes in one direction.


## Graph Representation

Graphs are represented through adjacency matrixes or adjacency lists.

**Adjacency Matrix**

A 2-dimensional array. Can look like a chessboard, but with 1s and 0s.

The cross section lets you figure out what is connected to what using the nodes as coordinates, and 1s as confirmed links. e.g. if A and C's intersection has 1, they are connected.

No connection? 0.

**Sparse vs Dense**

A graph is sparse if there are few connections, and dense if there are many. Think of it like, mosquito net vs fishing net.

**Adjacency List**

A more common method of showing graphs, with a node showing its connection to other nodes.

```
A -> C -> D // A is connected to C and D

B -> C -> F // B is connected to C and F

C -> A -> B -> E // C is connected to A, B, and E.

```

## Weighted Graphs

A graph with numbers assigned to the edges. Numbers are weights.

When using a matrix the numbers (weights) are used instead of just 1s.

Adjacency lists just link the weights to the node.

```
A -> B,4 -> D,9 -> C,3 // A is connected to B with weight 4, D with weight 9, and C with weight 3.
```

## Traversals

Graphs must be traversed, very similarly to trees.

**Breadth First**

Start at a specific node, which is called when using ``breadthFirst()``.

In order to prevent infinite loops, you have to keep track of the nodes visited.

Breadth First means checking the nodes closest to the specified node first and going outwards, level by level.

**BF Algo:**

1. `Enqueue` start node into a Queue.
2. Loop as long as nodes exist.
3. `Dequeue` the initial node.
4. If the `DQ'd` node has any unvisited nodes, add the unvisited to the `visited` tracker.


```js
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
```

**Depth First**

Uses a Stack.

**DF Algo**

1. `Push` specified node into the stack.
2. Loop while stack is not empty.
3. `Peek` at top of node in stack.
4. If top node has unvisited child nodes, mark top as visited, then `Push` unvisited child nodes into stack.
5. Once top node doesn't have an unvisited child nodes, `Pop` the top node off.
6. Repeat until stack is empty.

## Real World Uses of Graphs

- GPS/Mapping
- Driving directions
- Social networks
- Airline traffic
