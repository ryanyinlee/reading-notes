### Design web pages with CSS

##### What is CSS?

CSS are Cascading Style Sheets. This language will make your HTML look nice with a simple syntax system.

###### What is CSS for?

**Document**: Structured text file, usually with HTML, but also with markup languages such as SVG or XML.

CSS is **presented** to a form readable by users, usually through a web browser, but can also be seen through other **user agents**.

##### CSS Syntax

CSS is rule based where the coder creates a style which is applied across the elements specified. 

It starts with a selector (this time for HTML).

> h1

Then usees curly braces to encapsulate the **declarations** which have the following:

**Property**: The property being adjusted
**Value**: The value of the property to be adjusted to

e.g.
> color: red;

Color is the property and red is the value.
