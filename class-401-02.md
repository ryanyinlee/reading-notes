## Class 02 Reading Notes

Readings: Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

Review, Research, and Discussion
In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

**Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does**

Creates a new array that has had some function applied to each element in it from a prior array ("mapped across")

**Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does**

Applies a reducer function to the array that should reduce the Array into a single statement/value.

**Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result**

```
function getsAThing (aCityName) {
  superagent.get('https://geocode.xyz/' + aCityName + '?json=1')
  .then( data => {  
  console.log(aCityName);
  console.log('longitude: ' + data.body.longt);
  console.log('latitude: ' + data.body.latt);
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
}

getsAThing('seattle');
```

**With normal Promise .then() syntax**

```

let evenNumber = 700;
let oddNumber = 701;

// Returns a new Promise

function isEven(input) {

   return new Promise( (resolve,reject) => {      
      if(input % 2 == 0) {resolve(input + ' is even.');}
      else {reject('Do nothing');}

   });

}

isEven(evenNumber)
 .then(status => console.log(status))
  .catch( err => console.error(err))

isEven(oddNumber)
 .then(status => console.log(status))
  .catch( err => console.error(err))
```

**Again with async / await syntax**

```
let pauseTime = 500;

function getRandomNumber () {

     return new Promise( (resolve,reject) => {      
      
      setTimeout( () => {
        console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
      }, pauseTime)

   });
}

getRandomNumber();
```

**Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student**

A Promise is something that gets returned with two possible results, resolve or reject at some point in the future since it's not yet fully decided as it's in an asynchronous method.

It starts out as pending than can go to resolved or rejected.

If it's resolved the promise was fulfilled. If it's rejected the promise failed because of a specific reason or error, which then gets handled by a then method.


**Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?**

Callbacks aren't always asynchronous, they just happen to be useful for them.
