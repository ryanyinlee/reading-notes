## Class 11 Reading Notes: Event Driven Applications

**Why is access control important?**

For security reasons, limiting access to only authorized users prevents unauthorized or unwanted access to controlled resources by still allowing for certain users to read or use things, but not maliciously (or unintentionally) 


**Describe an application that would need access control.**

A simple message application like one we've been working on would require access control for users to be able to place and delete messages. More granular access control would be required so they would only be able to delete their own messages.

**What is a role used for?**

Roles are necessary in order to differentiate users to give them specific privileges that prevent them from intentionally or unintentionally reducing functionality for other users.

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

Role based lets you start users out with basic permissions and then increase them gradually while still allowing access with initial authorization.

- *Authorization*: The mechanism used to define whether or not a user has access and or privileges in an application or system.

- *Role Based Access Control*: Giving permission or access to users based on their role. Roles are much easier to manage than managing each individual's permissions.

- *Capabilities*: The permissions given to each role, examples include the basic CRUD abilities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
