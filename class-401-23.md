# Class 27 Reading Notes

**How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?**

React is a library created through Javascript that renders HTML and CSS.

**What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?**

Functional components are JS functions, in this context using React.

Class components are simple classes with multiple functions that make up React.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Functional Components: Independent and reusable code that React uses to bring in HTML.
- Children / Child Components: Children allow you to pass components as data to other components.

## Class 27 Live Notes / Learning Journal

## Warm Up

Prompt: Creating a feature called history that tracks URLS that a user enters for input

Want to be able to go backwards and forwards

When history goes backwards wants to retrieve the most recent

Most recently retrieved from backwards to go forwards

How would you implement the history feature?

- Acts just like a browser 

## Review: React Function Components

Conceptual review 

Difference between a class and a function component?

Func component: Plain JS function that returns a JSX/REACT component.

Class doesn't only return JSX - they represent objects.

    Encapsulates more than just the ability to return JSX.

    We can define other types of functionality besides return JSX can also attach a toggle function, a fetch function.

    Can live on the component, vs a functional component requires another function.


What do we lose? We don't have the ability to attach functionality directly to our component?

    Use Hooks!

## useState / Hooks
