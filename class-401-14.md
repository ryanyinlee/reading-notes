# Class 13 Reading Notes: Message Queues

**What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?**

https://www.amx.com/en/site_elements/benefits-and-applications-of-websockets

It means that the server can send updates asynchronously without requiring requests on behalf of the client. This is useful as it allows for faster real-time updates.

**Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?**

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33188147/socket-io-without-http-server

Socket.io does require an HTTP server in order to get the initial "handshake."

**What happens when a client emits an event?**

https://socket.io/docs/v4/emitting-events/

The client emits when there is an event that is received by a listener on the server side.

**What happens when a server emits an event?**

The server emits when there is an event that is received by a listener on the client side.

**What happens if a client “misses” an event?**

It should still be listening continuously, assuming the emitting is also being done continuously.

**How can we mitigate this?**

It can be mitigated by using `volatile` events, which is suppoed to wait until the underlying connection is ready.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/#socket

- Socket: The fundamental class for interacting with the server. Works as an event emitter which sends and receives events over the network.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

- Web Socket: The interface for connecting to a server using websocket.

https://socket.io/docs/v4/

- Socket.io: A library that allows real-time communication between server and browser.

- Client: The browser program used by the user to connect and get information to and from the server.

- Server: Where the browser connects to get information to and from the client.

https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/

- OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnection. Basically the conceptual difference between the very lowest layer of physical computer operation, (e.g. raw bits or electrons at the bottom) vs higher concept data movement where human interaction takes place. Has 7 layers.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/

- TCP Model: Transmission Control Protocol Model. A variance of the OSI model that uses 4 layers: Application Layer, Transport Layer, Internet Layer, and Network Access Layer. Follows a horizontal approach with less boundaries.

https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/internet/protocols/tcp

- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol is a primary protocol of the internet where the client requests from the server using discrete packets of data, split up and re-ordered so they make sense.

https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/

- UDP: User Datagram Protocol. A communication protocol used for time sensitive applications like video playback. Faster and more "up to date" as it continuously sends packets before a formal connection is established.

https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/

- Packets: A smaller segment of a larger piece of data that is sent over networks.
