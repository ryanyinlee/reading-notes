**Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware**

1. Cookie management and parsing of cookies.

2. Authentication of a user.

3. Serve a static file such as HTML, CSS, or JS.

**True or false: The route handler is middleware?**

False. It's not middleware unless you specifically set up router level middleware.

**In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?**

"If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging."

**At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?**

The request.

**What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”**

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7042340/error-cant-set-headers-after-they-are-sent-to-the-client

The body is written or state is finished but another function tried to set a header or status code.

- Middleware: Functions with access to req and res, or the next middeware, by using next();
- Request Object: The HTTP request from the client.
- Response Object: The HTTP response sent after getting an HTTP request.
- Application Middleware: "database middleware, application server middleware, message-oriented middleware, web middleware and transaction-processing monitors"
- Routing Middleware: Middleware that comes in between the request and the response.
- Test Driven Development: Creating test cases that require specific aspects and then writing code to satisfy the tests cases.
- Behavioral Testing: Testing the external behavior of the program.



## Class 03 Live Notes

Learning about TDD.

You make the test first.

Write the code to satisfy the test. Test will fail until code properly fits.

How to then test that JSON:

REST - Representational State Transfer

Server is stateless, our clients just want some data.

For every route we use hte name of the data entity as a route pre/post fix.

Method tells our server what type of operation we are performing.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- GET -> Read
- POST -> Create
- PATCH/PUT -> Update
- DELETE -> Delete

For a single route we may have several operations.

- GET /message
- POST /message
- PUT /message
- DELETE /message

Example of methods and paths:

Router:

```
const express = require ('express');

const { MessageModel } = require('../model');
const router = express.Router();


router.get('/message', read)
router.get('/message/:id', read)
router.post('/message', create)
router.patch('/message/:id', update)
router.put('/message/:id', update)
router.delete('/message/:id', remove)

async function read(req, res, next) {


console.log('Reading from messages.');

let messages = await MessageModel.findAll();

}

function create(req, res, next) {

}

function update(req, res, next) {

}

function remove(req, res, next) {

}

module.exports = router;

```

Examples of TDD commands via JEST

```

const response = await request
.toEqual(200)

.toBeDefined();
```

Testing:

Connect to a running SQL machine that has a specific database:

Define tables with column values.

Each table requires a primary key that must be unique.

Can make the primary key a text field.

Seqelize can

Bring in sequelize: 

```
'use strict'

const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require ('sequelize');
const POSTGRES_URI = process.env.POSTRES_URI || 'sqlite:memory';

const messageSchema = require('./message.schema.js');

const MessageModel = messageSchema(db, DataTypes);

// create a connectioon instance singleton, using a connection string (like a URL)
// typical connection string: postgresql://localhost:5432@username:password/db

let db = new Sequelize(POSTGRES_URI); // takes a string that canconnect us to a running sequelize DB

module.exports = {
    db,
    MessageModel,
};
```

string that must be different when deployed


```

const POSTGRES_URI = process.env.POSTRES_URI || 'sqlite:memory';


let db = new Sequelize(POSTGRES_URI);
```

Example of a SQL thingy:

Note that the sequelize has a different syntax as it's a singleton (can only be one)
