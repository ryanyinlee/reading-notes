# Class 32 Reading Notes: Context API - Behaviors

**When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?**

Context consumer components should be used.

**What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?**

Changing from light to dark mode. Changing a list with a filter.

**How can you best test context?**

Use actual tests of the components instead of mocking e.g.

Test a component with children that consume context

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- context: A way to pass data through components.
- useContext(): A way to use context data.
- static context: A context that belongs to the class and will be loaded along with it.

# Class 32 Live Notes / Live Journal

Code review showed me several good methods for pagination.

For some reason I couldn't get my head around it.

## Context API - Behaviors

Creating a way to effect change through our context.

1) Convert to a functional component.

2) Create a behavior/method to handle stateChange

3) Change mode from dark to light.


this.state = {
    mode: 'dark'
}

<main style= {styles[this.context.mode]}>

Functions do stuff, return data.

Functions must assign a return of a function to a value

```js
function Theme(props {

    let [mode, setMode] = useState("dark");
    
        // condition ? true : false
    const toggleMode = () => {
        console.log('Theme Context / ToggleMode Called');
        setMode(mode === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
    };

    let state = {
        mode,
        toggleMode
    };


    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value = {state}>
        {props.children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
})

export default Theme;
```

```js
<ThemeContext.Consumer>
{(themeContext) => (
<>
<h2>Current Mode: {themeContext.mode}</h2>
<span onClick ={themeContext.toggleMode}>Toggle Mode</span>
</>
)}
</ThemeContext.Consumer>


```

Behaviors let you change the state of your application from children.


## Lab Phase 2: Persistence

- Extend context

write a function to display or hide completed items (e.g. a toggle)

number of items per display

create a function that makes local storage
