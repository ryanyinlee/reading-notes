Add authentication truthy to functions

const jwt = res.__raw; TWO UNDERSCORES


```
getBooks = async () => {

    if (this.props.auth0.isauthenticated) {
        const res = await this.props.auth0.getIdTokenClaims();

        const jwt = res.__raw; // TWO UNDERSCORES

        //axios npm

        const config = {
            method: 'get',
            baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_URL,
            url: '/books',
            headers: {"Authorization"L `Bearer ${jwt}}
        }

        const bookResponse = await(axios(config));
        this.setState({books: bookResponse.data});
    }
}
```

Auth 0
- server first!
    - make an auth module that has all of the functions and req you need to create the verify user function
        - define client
        - define getKey function
        - define verifyUser function
    - export the verifyuser function
    - on the route use the verifyUser function to obtain the user's data as needed (EMAIL!!!)
    - use that in our DB processes
        - set up the index.js as the provider
        - make sure to get YOUR auth0 application keys for the provider

- client
    - set up the index.js as your provider (see docs)
    - make sure to get YOUR auth0 app keys for the provider
    - you can now access this.props.auth0
    - create a login and logout button from the code in the auth0 docs
    - once logged in you can access this.props.auth0.user
    - make sure to wrap any component using auth0 in {with auth0} each individual that uses this.props.auth0
