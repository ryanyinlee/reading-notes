## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/

**In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

**100’s =** Gives a confirmation of receipt, but it may not be able to respond due to the protocols used. Can also indicate that even if the connection is accepted, it may refuse other data.

**200’s =** Codes for when things are working correctly (for the most part) with the exception of 202, which just says the validation requirements were met.

**300’s =** Connection was successful, but the resource is somewhere else.

**400’s =** When the client has an issue rather than the server due to timeouts, incorrect routing, or lack of authentication. The data must be checked and resent.

**500’s =** When the server has an error. The client tries to get data in a way that causes the server to crash behind the scenes.

**What is a status code 202?** 

Accepted with a valid request, but the process isn't quite done or ready yet.

**What is a status code 308?**

Permanent redirect. Easier to reach the same or similar resources.

**What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**

204 No Content

**What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**

404 

**What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?**

403

**Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?**

It needs to be pulled out because it will not be the same string used when actually deployed. .env files let those be changed quickly and easily for different environs.

**What is middleware?**

Code that runs when the server gets a request, but before it gets passed to routes.

**What does app.use(express.json()) do?**

It's a way to let our server accept JSON as a body inside of a getelement.

**What does the /:id mean in a route?**

This manes it's a paramater accessible via req.params.id

**What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?**

Patch updates based on what the user enters, which is just the specific data sent. Put would replace all of the data at once.

**How do you make a default value in a schema?**

By creating a JavaScript object  that has specific keys.

**What does a 500 error status code mean?**

Internal server error. Problems happened with the server internally when something was requested.

**What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?**

201 is for successful notification upon the creation of a resource. The difference between 201 and 200 is 200 just states the request was understood and processed.

### Sorting: 

visualgo.net for visual/animated algorithms:

Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g. integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, non-decreasing, decreasing, non-increasing, lexicographical, etc).


There are many different sorting algorithms, each has its own advantages and limitations.


Sorting is commonly used as the introductory problem in various Computer Science classes to showcase a range of algorithmic ideas.


Without loss of generality, we assume that we will sort only Integers, not necessarily distinct, in non-decreasing order in this visualization. Try clicking Bubble Sort for a sample animation of sorting the list of 5 jumbled integers (with duplicate) above.

Sorting problem has a variety of interesting algorithmic solutions that embody many Computer Science ideas:

Comparison versus non-comparison based strategies,
Iterative versus Recursive implementation,
Divide-and-Conquer paradigm (this or that),
Best/Worst/Average-case Time Complexity analysis,
Randomized Algorithms, etc.

When an (integer) array A is sorted, many problems involving A become easy (or easier):

Searching for a specific value v in array A,
Finding the min/max or the k-th smallest/largest value in (static) array A,
Testing for uniqueness and deleting duplicates in array A,
Counting how many time a specific value v appear in array A,
Set intersection/union between array A and another sorted array B,
Finding a target pair x ∈ A and y ∈ A such that x+y equals to a target z, etc.

### CRUD

How a database updates.

- CREATE
- READ
- UPDATE
- DELETE

SQL database looks just like a spreadsheet. ID number.

Schema is the shape of the data.

Why use a database not attached to storage?

- More storage power.
- Memory gets reset on servers (more persistence assured).
- More secure for long term access.
- More personalization. 
- Duplication of information for redundancy (backup/safety)
- Consistent data.

REST - CRUD

get - read
post - create
put/patch - update
delete - delete

schema defining the shape of the data


```
const { Schema } = mongoose;
const Cat = require('./models/catModel.js');
require('dotenv').config();

const catSchema = new Schema({
    name: String,
    color: String,
    hasClaws: Boolean,
    location: String
})

const Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', catSchema);

module.exports = Cat;
```

seed.js - Seed data for database.

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Cat = require('./catModel);

// write a function that 

// connects to the DB

// adds cat records to the DB

// disconnects

// write function

// ANYTIME you do DB stuff it is async as it takes time to get stuff from the DB

async function seed() {
    mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_URL);

    const myCat = new Cat({
        name: 'Mya',
        color: 'Black and white',
        hasClaws: true,
        location: 'Seattle'
    });
    await myCat.save(function (err) {
    if (err){
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log('saved my cat, Mya');
    }
});

// alternatively

await Cat.create({
    name:'Poncho',
    color: 'Black and brown',
    hasClaws: true,
    location: 'Seattle'
})

await Cat.create({
    name:'Casper',
    color: 'White',
    hasClaws: true,
    location: 'Richmond'
})

mongoose.disconnect();

}

```


clear.js need to run a clear to wipe out the node

```



```


in the server.js

```
app.get('/cats', handleGetCats);

async function handleGetCats(req, res) {
let locationFromClient = {}
if (req.query.location) {
    locationFromClient = { location: req.query.location }
    // locationFromClient = req.query
}

    try {
        const catsFromDB = await Cat.find(locationFromClient)
        if (catsFromDB.length > 0) {
            res.status(200).send(catsFromDB);
        } else {
            res.status(404).send('no cats found');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('server error');
    }
}

```

### Front End  (App.js)

```
const url = 'http://localhost:3001'

**above export default**

constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        cats:[]
    }
}




getCats = async (location=null) => {
    const fullUrl = location ? `${url}/cats?location=${location}` : `${url}/cats`
    let catResponse = await axios.get(url);
    // set some state so we can render the cats
    this.setState({cats: catResponse.data});

}

componentDidMount() {
    this.getCats();
}

**the render return area**
{this.state.cats.length > 0 && this.state.cats.map(cat => <li>{cat.name} : {cat.location}</li>)}
**render return area**

```
