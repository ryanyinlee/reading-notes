### Google's Team Building

The most productive employees build larger networks through eating with other colleagues. 

Traits for good managers: good communication and avoiding micromanagement.

Successful team members had higher "Average Social Sensitivity" - A method of intuiting how others feel based off of physical cues. More likely to know when someone was upset or left out.

This creates an atmosphere of "psychological safety" - where it feels safe for people to take risks without fear of a social reprisal or embarassment. This leads to a team that is more cohesive, with better communication with better results.

Interestingly enough, I worked today with Jordan Watts and Brian Thornburg and I think I felt like I had more psychological safety as we worked together. I believe this made it so I could get more done vs had I worked alone.
