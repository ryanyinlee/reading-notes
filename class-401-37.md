# Class 41 Reading Notes: React Native

**Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”**

Regular Redux requires a lot of boilerplate code.

Redux Toolkit has a lot more built in tools. 

From -1

```
- immer.js => a library/tool to handle immutability in stores.
- redux => For state management
- redux-thunk =>For async tasks
- reselect => For selecting a slice out of global store
- automatic support for Redux Dev-tools Extension
```

**What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit**

Takes the common Redux use cases into utility functions that don't have to be written by hand. -2

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- redux toolkit slices: A collection of reducer logic/actions for a single feature, using a "slice" of state -3
- namespace: A tool for Redux that puts component state into a place you can use it.

Warmup: Given an integer, find the next greatest value in a binary search tree.

- Given value is not guaranteed the root.
- We have access to the root of the tree.
- Return null if nothing is higher.

## Conceptual Review

- React Hooks API
    - Functions that are invoked within React
    - Hooks into React specific stuff
    - Replace objected 'this'
    - Use state, hooks into lifecycle methods on components
    - Implement functionality important to multiple components
    - Custom Hooks

```js

// custom hooks return getters and setters
function useFirm(callback){
    let [formState, setForm] = useState({});

    function onSubmit(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        callback(formState[value]);
    }

    return [formState,setForm,submit];
}

function personForm(){
    let [formState, setForm, onSubmit] = useForm(console.log);

    return (
        <form onSubmit = {onSubmit}>
        </form>
    )
}

```

- React Contact API:
    - Works with component tree (Allows components global access to values stored above without directly passing props).
    - Before something like context, we have to pass directly from parent through child.
    - Context hooks into component tree using Providers/Consumers.
    - Consumers can now opt in to values stored in a Provider.

- React Redux API:
    - Create a Global Application state object used by all important components.
    - Using Providers and Consumers as well
    - Having a Reducer, while not pretty, does give us some peace of mind for how our applications change.

## React Native

- Component library with the goal of converting JS syntax into objective-c or Java.
- We get access to fancy tools that take all of the hard work.
    - Install some extra CLI tools (expo) and runtime environments (xcode or visual studio / your phone)

## Expo

- Workflow management tool
    - Compile your JS into executable code that will run on hte device of your choosing.

We can install dependencies with 'expo install <dependency-name>`
- Not required but recommended.

Running on iOS:
- Emulation will need Xcode installed as well as Xcode command line tools.
    - `x-code select --install`
- Need the Xcode IDE from the app store.
- Provides all the SDKs and emulator for devices.
- If this is your first time runnig xcode you will need to create a license.
    - `sudo xcodebuild -license`
