## Class 07 Reading

**Write the following steps in the correct order:** https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication

Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret

Receive authorization code

Receive access token

Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party

Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

Make a request to the access token endpoint

Make a request to a third-party API endpoint


- Honestly not sure about this one.


**What can you do with an authorization code?**

Exchange it for tokens.

**What can you do with an access token?**

Access OAuth protected resources.

**Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

Users can log into a service that they already have access to, to create a user login for your site without having to create a new login.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms 

https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/

*Client ID*: A public identifier for apps. Should be protected, even if public. Like an application username.

*Client Secret*: Known only to the application and auth server. Acts as the application's password. Not necessary for single page or mobile apps (public apps).

https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth#endpoints

*Authentication Endpoint*: Interacts with resource owner to get authorization to use the resource. Grants an authorization code.

*Access Token Endpoint*: After getting an authorization code, come here to get the access token.

*API Endpoint*: Take the access token here to get access to the API.

*Authorization Code*: Code received from the authentication endpoint.

*Access Token*: Token received from the access token endpoint.

# Class 07 Live Notes: Bearer Authentication

If basic auth uses strings.

Bearer is designed to use a token.

- We are still attaching an encoded string onto the header
- We are still decoding it and authenticating.
- Our encoded string will now be a token. -> JSON Web Token (jwt)

## What is a JWT?

It is credentials.

Takes the place of username and passowrd, but can control the features of the credentials.
- We can make them one time use.
- We can make them timed.
- And we can validate them with a server secret.
    - Has someone messed with the encoding? If so, invalid token.
    - We get to decide what info is encoded.
- Each token is signed with a secret string.

### Sequelize Virtual Property

- A property that is not stored in our SQL table.
- Derived using values stored in the table.
    - Uses a special type of function called a `getter`.

```js
        let User = await Users.create(username, password);

        User.token // returns a property derived from stored data == aksjdfjkasdhlfkja.98938493



```

    bearermiddleware.js

```js
'use strict';


const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// read the req.headers.authorization

// use jwt to verify the tokens integrity

// jwt.verify(token, APP_SECRET); // returns payload or error


```


    user model

```js

    'use strict';

// Create a Sequelize model

const sequelize = require("sequelize");

const userSchema = (sequelize, DataTypes) => sequelize.define('User', {
    username: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },
    password: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    }
  });


  // our before create hook (this is hook is built in)
  // userSchema.beforeCreate();

    // can authenticate on the user model
  // userSchema.authenticateStrings = function(username, password) {

  // }

  // userSchema.prototype.authenticateStrings = function () {};


  /* 

  const bcrypt
  const jwt 
  
  const APP_SECRET = process.env.APP_SECRET || 'secretstringfortest';

  const userSchema = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {

    let model = sequelize.define('User', {
      username: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },
    password: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },
    token: {
      type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,
      get() {
        return jwt.sign({username: this.username}, APP_SECRET);
      }
    }
    });

    model.beforeCreate(async (user) => {
      user.password = await bcrypt.has(user.password, 10);
    });

    // fat arrow do not bind this properly
    model.authenticateBasic = async function(username, password) {
      let user = this.findOne({ where: {username} });
      let isValid = bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

      if (isValid) {
        return user;
      } else {
        throw new Error('Invalid user.);
      }
    };

    model.authenticateBearer = async function(token) {


    };

    return model;
  };
  
 
  
  */

  module.exports = userSchema; //type here is function

```
