# Class 18 Readings: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

**Describe a use case for a serverless function.**

A microserver can process a payment from a phone without having to access a larger servere.

**If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**

I think the best way may be to create multiple small programs that operates a very minimal focus function.

**Describe how a CDN works**

A CDN is the digital version of not putting your eggs into one basket, and then putting that basket in a ton of different places. If you want an egg, you can go to the nearest basket, and if that basket is crushed or dropped, there are other baskets with eggs around (if a bit further away). The result is you can get your egg faster and more reliably.
