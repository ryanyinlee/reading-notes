## Class 12 Reading Notes: Socket.io

**What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?** https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/

Popping information into packets increases reliability by not relying on the successful transfer of a large file, but multiple smaller files which are more likely to succeed being completely transferred.


**UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?**  https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/

UDP doesn't require a connection on the receiving end to be accepted before sending packets through. This is useful for voice or video as it reduces latency.

However there is no TCP handshake so it can be used maliciously through DDoS attacks.


**Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11129212/tcp-can-two-different-sockets-share-a-port/

Yes, a socket server can have multiple connections, as when listening via a port, the incoming connection is handed off to another process or thread.

A single client can have up to 64k connections to a server with the same port.


**Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8798874/can-many-servers-communicate-with-one-client-on-one-socket/

Yes it can, although you need a socket per connection and multiple ports per client.

**Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?**

Yes, this is possible.
