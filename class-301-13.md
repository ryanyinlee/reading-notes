**What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer scene?**

Personal computers were ending up in homes as regular consumer devices. The marketing was almost entirely to the male market, and this influenced the culture around them as being a gendered device. Families were more likely to purchase computers for boys even though girls were interested in them.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

This affected how computer science and other STEM classes were taught - with the assumption that most people who enter these fields of study had already played with and had experience with computers at home.

**What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

Every single tech company is staffed by males who are white or Asian, over-represented compared to the US population.

With some exceptions Latino and black people are mostly under-represented in the staffing.

Tech companies are very slightly more diverse than the top US companies or US congress, but not necessarily by gender, and rarely for Latin or black employees in comparison to the population.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When they are encouraged by the top of the company down, which means a meaningful commitment from leadership who understand why diversity is important and useful.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Diverse teams are able to offer more in terms of creativity and innovation as they bring different viewpoints. These diverse organizations benefit financially as well. It may also be the type of leadership that values diversity are more likely to treat their workers more ethically.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

Products are more likely to be useful to a wider variety of consumers if they are developed by a diverse team. The example given in the article is how YouTube was developed entirely by right handed people, which made it so those who film left handed had serious issues when it came to uploading videos due to orientation of their left handed filming.

Daniel linked us Schema vs Model: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22950282/mongoose-schema-vs-model/22950402

```
In mongoose, a schema represents the structure of a particular document, either completely or just a portion of the document. It's a way to express expected properties and values as well as constraints and indexes. A model defines a programming interface for interacting with the database (read, insert, update, etc). So a schema answers "what will the data in this collection look like?" and a model provides functionality like "Are there any records matching this query?" or "Add a new document to the collection".

```

Post vs Put

Post = You are mailing a cat in the post.

Put = You are putting the cat's fur and update: They hate it.
