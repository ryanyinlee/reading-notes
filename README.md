## Reading: 01 - Learning Markdown

Markdown is a method of text formatting, but not WYSIWYG for GitHub and some other online places like Reddit. Adds things like italics and bolding.

GitHub has some unique MD features that don't work elsewhere.

### Text Formatting

Bold is fairly simple. You add two asterisks before the text. **

**Bold**

Italics use just one asterisk. * 

*Italic*

Example: **This line of text is bold.**

Example 2: *This line of text is italic.*

Strikethrough is supposed to be double tilde (~~) but it seems like it is broken currently, at least in the Preview.

### Lists:

Numbered lists work just like normal.

1. List Item A
2. List Item B
3. List Item C

Asterisks create bullet point lists.

* List Item A
* List Item B
* List Item C

As do dashes: -
- List Item A
- List Item B
- List Item C

### Image Linking

In order to link an image you use an exclamation mark

![Description of image](link_to_image.jpeg)

### Headers

The # symbol changes headers. More # = smaller header. A singular # makes a bigger header. Put a space between the # and the header text.

# Sample of one "#"
## Sample of two "#"
### Sample of three "#"
#### Sample of four "#"
##### Sample of five "#"
###### Sample of six "#"

### Links

> [Text to be URled](URL)

Example: [Imgur](https://www.imgur.com)

### Quotes

Use > symbols to make block quotes.
