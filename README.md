### What is a Growth Mindset?

A Growth Mindset is a method of mental and intellectual advancement, fostered simply by attitude that embraces the idea that you as a person can become better and learn every day.

I'd like to think that I share some of the concepts of the Growth Mindset, but I can recall times where I unconsciously didn't have a growth mindset - however actually seeing it laid out in the [diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanyinlee/ryanyinlee/main/NewGrowthMindset2.png) makes it much easier to see the major concepts and adapt them. 

> - Challenges - Avoid or Face?
> - Obstacles - Loses Focus or Persists?
> - Effort - Views as fruitless or No pain, no gain?
> - Criticism - Ignores or Learns from?
> - Success of Others - Views as a threat or Is inspired by?

These are concepts that embody the best aspects of admirable people. They would see a challenge and face it, an obstacle doesn't dissuade them, the effort they put in is seen as a necessity, they are humble and attentive when given legitimate criticism, and they are magnanimous enough to see the success of others as worthy of celebration. If you met someone like this, it's likely you would immediately see they have great value, because even if they are lacking in some aspects, they are capable of improving.

Seeing it myself, I know it'll be a challenge, but I can ask myself these same questions when I come across them as I'm now more conscious of the concepts and why I was in a fixed mindset.

### The 3 Reminders

My main challenge will be coming across a difficult concept that I might normally avoid. This would be a **challenge** - I would have to ask myself the question, will I avoid or face this? Knowing what I know now, I can tell myself to face the challenge will allow me to grow.

Then comes the **effort** - the study, practice, and work. I have to remind myself that Effort isn't "fruitless". Rather than "No pain, no gain", I like the phrase, "If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth doing."

Then later, when all is said and done, **criticism** - Ego as a mental concept is difficult to put aside, but I have to remember that my ego will inhibit my growth if I refuse to learn from the analyses of my weaknesses.
