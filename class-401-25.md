# Class 29 Reading Notes: Advanced State with Reducers

**How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?**

Give useEffect a second parameter that is empty, e.g. `[]` as this will ensure it only runs once.

**Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?**

Yes, you can by having the variables in an object in the useState parentheses e.g. useState({ variable1: 0, variable2: 0})

**Is useState() synchronous?**

useState is asynchronous.
