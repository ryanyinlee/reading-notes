# Class 29 Reading Notes: Advanced State with Reducers

**How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?**

Give useEffect a second parameter that is empty, e.g. `[]` as this will ensure it only runs once.

**Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?**

Yes, you can by having the variables in an object in the useState parentheses e.g. useState({ variable1: 0, variable2: 0})

**Is useState() synchronous?**

useState is asynchronous.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook: A way to add state to a function component.
- Component Lifecycle: As a React component, an application gets used. Component goes through a set of events, starting with being mounted, and then eventually unmounted.

## Functional Reducers

We've used the reduce method on an array

```js

let array = [1,2,3,4];

// reducer is a way to functionally change state without mutations

let initialState = 0;

function reducerFunction(state, item) {
    return state + item;
}

let updatedState = array.reduce(reducerFunction, initialState);

console.log(updatedState) //10;

```

Don't use stock cover letters or resumes. Personalize and tweak them for each company. 

Resumes are scanned rapidly because of the large volume they receive.

Recruiters may not be familiar with the actual job they have listed.

Practice interviewing beforehand! Think about your specific skills and accomplishments. Management abilities and creativity with examples.
Prepare a "Tell Me About Yourself" and 'What's your Biggest Weakness?" Don't read from a script when answering. Try to include specific numbers if available. Do lots of mock interviews with other people as well as in a mirror so you are actually speaking instead of thinking of answers. 

Have questions about the company ready.

Don't spam them. Wait a few days before pinging them.

Work on speaking professionally.

If you don't know about the company or position you are less likely to be considered. Read as many sources as possible. Figure out the type of personality the company has, what thye're talking about. See if you can use what they sell first. Use your network to find people who have worked there. Figure out who you may be meeting, and what type of interview you will be getting.

Negotiate your salary. Do research on what is the noraml range.

If doing a tech interview, makes sure you're in a problem solving mindset.

Get good sleep the night before as it helps your cognitive abilities.
