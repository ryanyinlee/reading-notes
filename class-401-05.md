## Class 04 Reading Notes 

## Data Modeling

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-test-driven-development-tdd/

1. Only write the necessary code to pass the test.
2. Code is more modular. Create more tests to get more features.
3. Easier to maintain and refactor.

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54517032/beforeall-vs-beforeeach-when-to-use-them/54517433

These would be necessary for test conditions as the tests can change conditions depending on what runs first.

**What is one downside of Test Driven Development**

Can be slow going as you must write tests before writing code.

**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-es6-class-and-es5-function-constructors/

ES6 use of *this* keyword. Any function in Constructor/Prototype can be used as a constructor.

**Why REST?** https://stackify.com/soap-vs-rest/#:~:text=REST%20allows%20a%20greater%20variety,considered%20easier%20to%20work%20with.&text=REST%20is%20generally%20faster%20and%20uses%20less%20bandwidth.


REpresentational State Transfer alows a greater variety of data formats.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
