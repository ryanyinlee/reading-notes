# Class 14 Reading Notes: Event Driven Architecture

**Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-standard-and-fifo-first-in-first-out-queues-28d1ea5e153

Standard queues: Best effort ordering, generally what is sent in will be sent out in the same order, but this isn't guaranteed due to message volume.

FIFO: The order of messages is strictly preserved.


**How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

The client program can have a confirmation message sent to the server upon receipt of a message via an event.

**What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**

I think it should be close to a messaging pattern.

**How do you test an event driven system?**

I would test an event driven system by creating tests that start events and make sure their output matches what is expected. 

They should be done out of order if that is a potential issue, and with inputs that wouldn't make sense to catch edge cases.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- FIFO Queue: A queue that is strictly First In First Out, preserving its order.

- Pub/Sub: Publish/subscribe messaging is an asynchronous communication used for serverless systems. All subscribers receive the message.
Useful for event-driven stuff. A "fan out approach".
