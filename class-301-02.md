## React: Component Lifecycle Events

**Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**

Based off the diagram, it appears that 'render' happens first visually - but phase descriptions note that 'render' happens during Updating, which appears to be secondary to Mounting.

**What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

Mounting - The component is created and put into the DOM.

**Put the following things in the order that they happen:** 

1. ``constructor`
2. ``render``
3. ``componentDidMount``
4. ``React Updates``
5. ``componentWillUnmount``

Hopefully this looks right.

**What does componentDidMount do?**

Runs after a component gets mounted, so useful for data that must be loaded remotely (the reading describes subscriptions - curious what that means exactly)

## React Bootstrap

Install via npm

``npm install react-boostrap boostrap@5.1.3``

Ideally only import specific components vs the entire library due to the size.

CSS styling may be required.

Sass is used to customize?

## React State vs Props

Props - arguments to a function, pass a component props (e.g. initial count). Initialize a component to or render like.

Display something to the user such as title/subtitle that can change.

The counter example he gives has the initial count passed as a prop, to a state inside of a component. 

**What types of things can you pass in the props?**

Static data.

**What is the big difference between props and state?**

Props are passed into a component from the outside where as states are handled inside of the component and are updated inside the component. Props can't be changed inside of the component.

**When do we re-render our application?**

When something is changed in the application based off of user input.

**What are some examples of things that we could store in state**

State is useful for storing user input from a form, or other data that is ONLY going to be used inside of that component.

## Things I want to know more about

For componentDidMount, what does it mean regarding subscriptions?

Regarding React Boostrap: What is Sass?

I'm not too great at watching videos, so I'll likely need some more hands-on examples on state vs prop.
