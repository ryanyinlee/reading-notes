## Component-Based Architecture

*"...[D]ecomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components..."* - tutorialspoint

Ensures *componnent reusability*

**What is a “component”?**

Components are reusable and self-contained units of code function that can be moved around quite easily, as well as interact with other components in a predictible manner, even in unusual circumstances.

They can have 3 different views: object-oriented, conventional, and process-related.

**What are the charactistics of a component?**

Reusability: Can be used again in different apps.

Replaceable: Can be swapped out.

Not context specific: Can operate in different contexts.

Extensible: Can be extended to create additional behaviors.

Encapsulated: Can be used without exposing its inner functions.

Independent: Can be used with minimal or no requirements on other components.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

Advantages are: Less development time and cost as devs use already made components and better reliability through tried and tested components.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**

Props is short for properties and is how data is passed from components. 

**How are props used in React?**

1. Define an attribute and its data.

2. Pass it to the child via props.

3. Render the passed data.

**What is the flow of props?**

These are sent in only one direction, and the data is read-only, unable to be changed by the receiving components.
