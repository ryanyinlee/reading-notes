## Class 10 Reading: Stackes and Queues

What is a stack? 

A data structure of nodes.

Each node references the next node in the stack.

Stack Terms:

1. Push - Push a node into the stack.
2. Pop - Pop a node out of the stack.
3. Top - Top of the stack is revealed.
4. Peek - Peek at the top of the stack.
5. IsEmpty - IsEmpty when stack is empty.

Stack is FILO/LIFO - First In Last Out / Last In First Out

First item added will be last item out.

## Time and Space

Pushing a node into a stack is O(1).

Popping a node off a stack is O(1).

Peeking a stack is O(1).

IsEmpty is a O(1).

## Pseudocode

Pushing Pseudo:

```js
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node

```

Popping Pseudo:

```js
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

Peeking Pseudo:

```js
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

IsEmpty Pseudo:

```js
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

## What is a Queue?

Terms:

1. Enqueue - Add nodes.
2. Dequeue - Remove nodes.
3. Front - First node.
4. Rear - Last node.
5. Peek - Look at the Front Node.
6. IsEmpty - True when empty, false when not.


FIFO/LILO - First in First Out / Last In Last Out


## Time and Space

Enqueue: O(1)

Dequeue: O(1)

Peek: O(1)

IsEmpty: O(1)

## Pseudocode

Enqueue
```js
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

Dequeue
```js
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

Peek
```js
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

IsEmpty
```js
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```

## Scott Lease's Quiz

What command would you use to remove a node from the top of the stack?

How many directions can we traverse through our nodes in a stack?

If we added "node 5" to a queue, what command would we use?

Why do we reset the temp when popping a node off the stack?

What could you tell me about the term Front in pertaining to queues?

Where does pop remove from the stack?

What do you need to create to remove a node from the stack?

What is the Big(0h) factor? of a push?

What does FILO stand for?

What does LIFO stand for?
