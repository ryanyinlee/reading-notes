# Class 28 Reading Notes: Component Lifecycle / useEffect()


**Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?**

React changes what appears on the page that renders what you need based on input. It looks like multiple pages but is not.

**If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?**

If using a Router, place it outside of the routes. Header for example. 

You can also make a specific component function and make it a parent for the routes.

**What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested**

They should just be unmounted, and then no longer rendered. React docs say they are destroyed after being unmounted. "Once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again."

**What does props.children contain?**

props.children should contain things that you don't know what exactly they'll be ahead of time. Useful for modularity.

**How do useState() and this.setState() differ?**

setState handles state in a class component. You build a state object, then modify it with this.setState("the new state")

useState handles state in a React hook in a functional component. You create a state, and a function to set the state 

e.g. const [stateToChange, functionToSetState] = useState('the initial state set when calling useState')

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook: A way to add state to a function component.
- Mounting: Constructor, Render Phase, (React Updates DOM and refs). Inserted into the tree.
- Un-Mounting: Destroys a component, never to be mounted again.

## Class 28 Live Notes / Learning Journal

Warmup: Code/drawings/whiteboard - 

Given two binary trees with head references T and S, having at most N nodes, write a function to check if S is present as a sub tree in T.

- What are hooks?

Something that hooks into the React API
- `useState` lets us define some `state`

- Why do we need state?
    - Allows us to use state without creating a class.
    - Setting dynamic values.


## Component Lifecycle

As a React component, an application gets used. Component goes through a set events.


add to deploy

a connected gh repo

a gh pages nodemodule

go to github

create a repo

git init

commit to github

when all committed, ready to deploy to gh pages

npm install gh-pages

go back to package.json and add some scripts

set homepage: to url for github page

"predeploy": "npm rum build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

npm run deploy
